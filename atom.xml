If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone SE (2020).</p><p>In this article, I’m going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock"><a href="#Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?"></a>Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?</h2><p>Many people have always asked me if it’s possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner"><a href="#Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner"></a>Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner</h2><p>This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone SE (2020) from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.</p><p>Sign in to the iCloud account&gt; Go to “Find My Apple iPhone SE (2020)”&gt; Select each and every device under this tab&gt; click “Erase iPhone.” Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we’ll proceed to the next step, which is to click the “Next” tab. Once we’ve done this, a new tab with “Remove Account” will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.</p><h3 id="Visit-an-Authorised-Apple-Store"><a href="#Visit-an-Authorised-Apple-Store" class="headerlink" title="Visit an Authorised Apple Store"></a>Visit an Authorised Apple Store</h3><p>You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it’s still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Jailbreak-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Jailbreak-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone</h2><p>You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone SE (2020) device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu.

Apple has placed the Apple iPhone SE (2020) as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.</p><p>Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone SE (2020). We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer"><a href="#Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Activation Lock Primer"></a>Part 1: Activation Lock Primer</h2><p>Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone SE (2020) gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.</p><p>Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020"><a href="#Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-SE-2020" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone SE (2020))"></a>Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone SE (2020))</h2><p>An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone but forgot to erase the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device before submitting and consequently, the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that Apple iPhone SE (2020) to make it useable again.

However, things get increasingly difficult from that point on if you do not have Apple ID credentials. You can use iCloud to erase the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device and remove the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device from the Apple ID account it is connected to, remotely. If you are an IT administrator deploying Microsoft services, you can use Microsoft Intune to get around the Activation Lock easily.</p><p>If you are an iPhone 5 to iPhone X user, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is available as an option to bypass Activation Lock on the iPhone.

Of course, this is mainly made by Apple through iCloud or Apple ID. This system is designed to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access.

As you may expect, this article will help you <strong>remove the iCloud Activation Lock</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg"                      alt="activation lock page ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device to a specific Apple ID.</p><h3 id="Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock</h3><p>Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.</p><p>In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password"><a href="#Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.</p><p>If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. If the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to <strong>Settings &gt;</strong> Tap on the profile on top of the app &gt; <strong>Sign Out</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-02.jpg"                      alt="icloud sign out button"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten your Apple ID, it can be recovered by signing in with your Apple ID account.

This feature securely stores your connected device to Apple’s activation servers. You will see an activation window on your Apple iPhone SE when you reset your device. However, to remove the iPad activation lock, you first need to enter the connected account.</p><p>Still, there are times you might need to know how to <strong>bypass Apple iPhone SE</strong> Activation Lock. Perhaps you may fail to remember your iCloud credentials, or the screen isn’t responsive. Most frequently, a phone is second-hand or gifted, and the first user forgets to remove it from their iCloud account.</p><p>Whatever your reason, we’ll walk you through <strong>Apple iPhone SE iCloud bypass.</strong> Also, we will give you the best tools available in the market for your case.</p><h2 id="Part-1-5-Best-Ways-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-SE-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-5-Best-Ways-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-SE-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 5 Best Ways to Bypass Apple iPhone SE Activation Lock"></a>Part 1: 5 Best Ways to Bypass Apple iPhone SE Activation Lock</h2><h3 id="1-Ask-the-previous-device-owner-for-Apple-ID-and-passcode"><a href="#1-Ask-the-previous-device-owner-for-Apple-ID-and-passcode" class="headerlink" title="1. Ask the previous device owner for Apple ID and passcode"></a>1. Ask the previous device owner for Apple ID and passcode</h3><p>For an iPhone activation lock bypass, you’ll require a couple of data:</p><p><strong>The owner’s Apple ID email and secret word.</strong> If you want to know how to bypass Activation Lock on iPhone or iPad, it’s frequently just about as straightforward as signing into the Apple iPhone SE device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the past owner.</p><p><strong>The owner’s four or six-digit passcodes.</strong> You might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock if a device isn’t deleted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-xs-xr-x-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="owner id"                ></p><p>The following steps show the way to <strong>bypass Apple iPhone SE</strong> activation lock:</p><ul><li>Turn on your phone and follow the on-screen prompts to set up the Apple iPhone SE device (language, WiFi, and so forth.)</li><li>When you see the “Sign In with Apple ID” screen, enter the Appl ID credentials of the previous owner.</li><li>With the correct credentials given, the process can proceed.</li><li>On the other hand, if you see the passcode screen, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone SE device without Apple ID.</li></ul><p>With the Apple iPhone SE device fully set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the iCloud account. You can now make one more ID and sign into it.</p><h3 id="2-Remotely-bypass-activation-lock-by-the-previous-owner"><a href="#2-Remotely-bypass-activation-lock-by-the-previous-owner" class="headerlink" title="2.

Remotely bypass activation lock by the previous owner</h3><p>The <strong>Apple iPhone SE iCloud bypass</strong> is likewise possible through iCloud. This method is helpful when the phone owner isn’t with you and can’t sign into their Apple ID. You’ll require their Apple ID details, and they might have to verify the login activity through a different device.</p><p>Yet iCloud is a great choice for remotely bypassing a device from a client’s Apple ID. The steps below will guide the owner on how they can remotely <strong>bypass Apple iPhone SE</strong> through iCloud:</p><ul><li>Visit the official iCloud website, i.e., iCloud.com, through a web browser.</li><li>Sign in with the Mac ID details (Note: If you are performing these steps, the owner might have to verify your login is real through an iPhone or iPad related to their ID).</li><li>Select the “Find iPhone” symbol (Note: This is the “Find My” feature; Apple hasn’t changed the name on iCloud.com. However, it works for all Apple devices).</li><li>On the guide, select the blue spot related to the Apple iPhone SE you want to sign into.</li><li>Select the “Erase iPhone” option.</li><li>Pick the “Remove from Account” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-xs-xr-x-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="remove from account"                ></p><h3 id="3-iForgot-website-to-reset-Apple-ID-and-passcode"><a href="#3-iForgot-website-to-reset-Apple-ID-and-passcode" class="headerlink" title="3. iForgot website to reset Apple ID and passcode"></a>3. iForgot website to reset Apple ID and passcode</h3><ul><li>Go to Apple’s iForgot site, enter your Apple ID credentials, and tap Continue.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-xs-xr-x-icloud-bypass-3.jpg"                      alt="sign in"                ></p><ul><li>Apple shows phone numbers related to the Apple ID (the numbers are covered up, and just the last two digits can be seen).

A list of all your connected Apple devices shows on the site. Click “Allow” in the Reset Password section to bypass the lock.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-xs-xr-x-icloud-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="allow the apple device"                ></p><ul><li>Enter your device password or macOS passcode and snap Continue.</li><li>Please create a new password, retype it in the Verify field, and click Next or Change.

Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.</p><p>With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple"><a href="#Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple"></a>Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple</h2><p>In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device happens to be the real owner, then he&#x2F;she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.</p><p>This approach, however, has a downside. It’s only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.</p><h2 id="Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock"><a href="#Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock"></a>Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock</h2><p>One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of the iCloud Activation Lock Removal process, you can easily bypass the iCloud Activation Lock and remove it completely from your device. The following is a detailed process on how you can seamlessly do it with the peace of mind that your data and all valuable information will be kept in place.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Purchase-the-Service"><a href="#Step-1-Purchase-the-Service" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Purchase the Service"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase the Service</h4><p>For you to unlock the iCloud lock, using this method, you first have to obtain the rights to do so.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 11 Pro device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="New-Guide-How-To-Check-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-On-Your-Apple-iPhone-7"><a href="#New-Guide-How-To-Check-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-On-Your-Apple-iPhone-7" class="headerlink" title="New Guide: How To Check iCloud Activation Lock Status On Your Apple iPhone 7"></a>New Guide: How To Check iCloud Activation Lock Status On Your Apple iPhone 7</h2><p>Apple’s iOS is renowned for its robust security features, including the iCloud Activation Lock. This feature plays a crucial role in safeguarding Apple devices against unauthorized access. It’s a way to ensure that only the rightful owner can use and access the Apple iPhone 7 device. Originally designed as a theft deterrent, the iCloud Activation Lock on used Apple Devices becomes especially important when buying or selling second-hand phones.</p><p>Understanding the status of this lock is essential to ensure a secure and legitimate transaction. In this 2024 guide, you’ll dive into how to <strong>check the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong>. It’s a critical step for anyone involved in the trade of used Apple devices online or otherwise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone activation lock page"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Check-Activation-Lock-Status-Before-You-Buy-a-Used-Device"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Check-Activation-Lock-Status-Before-You-Buy-a-Used-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device"></a>Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device</h2><p>Understanding the iCloud Activation Lock is essential when purchasing a used Apple device. This security feature, designed by Apple, is activated when ‘Find My iPhone’ is enabled. It links the Apple iPhone 7 device to the owner’s Apple ID, preventing others from activating it without the owner’s permission. This lock is crucial for preventing unauthorized use of lost or stolen devices.</p><p>Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, <strong>checking the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong> is important. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Power on the Apple iPhone 7 device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone 7 device has been properly erased.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone lockscreen"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> <strong>If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone 7 device still needs to be fully erased. In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone 7 device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start setting up the Apple iPhone 7 device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone 7 device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> During the setup, if the Apple iPhone 7 device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone 7 device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone 7 device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.</li></ul><p>If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an <strong>activation lock check</strong> when buying second-hand phones.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices"></a>Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices</h2><p>If you’re planning to sell your Apple iPhone 7 or are curious about the status of a lost phone, you should also perform an <strong>iCloud lock check</strong>. This feature, crucial for security, can prevent a new user from accessing the phone without your permission. Here’s how you can check the status:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone"><a href="#Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Check Within the Phone"></a>Method 1: Check Within the Phone</h3><p>The first way to check your devices’ iCloud activation lock status is through the Apple iPhone 7 devices themselves. There are two ways to do this, as presented in this section.</p><h4 id="Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App"><a href="#Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App"></a>Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App</h4><p>First, open Settings on your iDevice. At the top of its menu, tap on your profile name.</p><p>If you see an iCloud account listed here and you’re signed in, your device is still linked to that iCloud account. Thus, it will still be under the iCloud Activation Lock. If there is no iCloud activation lock, it should look like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone no icloud lock"                ></p><h4 id="Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation"><a href="#Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation"></a>Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation</h4><p>If you are setting up the phone afresh or after a factory reset, proceed with the initial setup steps. Suppose the Apple iPhone 7 device asks for an Apple ID and password previously associated with the Apple iPhone 7 device at any point during the setup. In that case, it indicates that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active. This occurs if the Apple iPhone 7 device was not correctly erased before the reset.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number"><a href="#Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using IMEI Number"></a>Method 2: Using IMEI Number</h3><p>Every iPhone or iPad has its own IMEI number. It can be used to check details about the Apple iPhone 7 device remotely, including <strong>checking the iCloud Activation Lock</strong>. Here are the steps to use your IMEI number to <strong>check the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong> of your phone using third-party apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your <strong>Settings</strong> app on the iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>General</strong>, then choose <strong>About.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find the <strong>IMEI</strong> number by scrolling down. It’s a 15-digit number that’s unique to your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-04.jpg"                      alt="imei page iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Several third-party websites offer services to check iCloud Activation Lock status using the IMEI number. Some of these services are free, while others might charge a small fee. Make sure to use a reputable service to avoid scams.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> On the chosen service’s website, enter your device’s IMEI number.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The service will provide details regarding the iCloud activation lock status.</li></ul><p>Remember, if selling, always erase your device and sign out of iCloud to remove the activation lock. For buyers, always ensure your device is free from previous iCloud accounts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Part 3: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock</h2><p>If you discover that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active on your iOS device, removing it is crucial, especially if you plan to sell or repurpose it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="New-Guide-How-To-Check-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-On-Your-Apple-iPhone-11"><a href="#New-Guide-How-To-Check-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-On-Your-Apple-iPhone-11" class="headerlink" title="New Guide: How To Check iCloud Activation Lock Status On Your Apple iPhone 11"></a>New Guide: How To Check iCloud Activation Lock Status On Your Apple iPhone 11</h2><p>Apple’s iOS is renowned for its robust security features, including the iCloud Activation Lock. This feature plays a crucial role in safeguarding Apple devices against unauthorized access. It’s a way to ensure that only the rightful owner can use and access the Apple iPhone 11 device. Originally designed as a theft deterrent, the iCloud Activation Lock on used Apple Devices becomes especially important when buying or selling second-hand phones.</p><p>Understanding the status of this lock is essential to ensure a secure and legitimate transaction. In this 2024 guide, you’ll dive into how to <strong>check the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong>. It’s a critical step for anyone involved in the trade of used Apple devices online or otherwise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone activation lock page"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Check-Activation-Lock-Status-Before-You-Buy-a-Used-Device"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Check-Activation-Lock-Status-Before-You-Buy-a-Used-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device"></a>Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device</h2><p>Understanding the iCloud Activation Lock is essential when purchasing a used Apple device. This security feature, designed by Apple, is activated when ‘Find My iPhone’ is enabled. It links the Apple iPhone 11 device to the owner’s Apple ID, preventing others from activating it without the owner’s permission. This lock is crucial for preventing unauthorized use of lost or stolen devices.</p><p>Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, <strong>checking the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong> is important. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Power on the Apple iPhone 11 device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone 11 device has been properly erased.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone lockscreen"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> <strong>If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone 11 device still needs to be fully erased. In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone 11 device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start setting up the Apple iPhone 11 device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone 11 device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> During the setup, if the Apple iPhone 11 device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone 11 device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone 11 device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.</li></ul><p>If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an <strong>activation lock check</strong> when buying second-hand phones.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices"></a>Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices</h2><p>If you’re planning to sell your Apple iPhone 11 or are curious about the status of a lost phone, you should also perform an <strong>iCloud lock check</strong>. This feature, crucial for security, can prevent a new user from accessing the phone without your permission. Here’s how you can check the status:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone"><a href="#Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Check Within the Phone"></a>Method 1: Check Within the Phone</h3><p>The first way to check your devices’ iCloud activation lock status is through the Apple iPhone 11 devices themselves. There are two ways to do this, as presented in this section.</p><h4 id="Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App"><a href="#Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App"></a>Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App</h4><p>First, open Settings on your iDevice.

Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 11 and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html" >bypass the iCloud activation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lock.</p><h3 id="What-Does-This-Mean-for-You"><a href="#What-Does-This-Mean-for-You" class="headerlink" title="What Does This Mean for You?"></a>What Does This Mean for You?</h3><p>If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 11 device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 11 device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone 11 is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.</p><p>Now that you know everything you need to know about an iCloud-locked iPhone, read on to find out how to unlock an iCloud-locked iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPhone-iPad-iPod-Safely-and-Efficiently-iOS-12-0-16-6-Supported"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPhone-iPad-iPod-Safely-and-Efficiently-iOS-12-0-16-6-Supported" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Unlock iCloud Locked iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;iPod Safely and Efficiently?

You may have forgotten your iCloud details, which include your Apple ID or your password. To get your details back, you can visit the Apple Store and follow the steps to retrieve your details. If you bought an iPhone from a seller, endeavor to ask them if it’s a second-hand iPhone and get the right details from the user.</p><p>This might seem like an easy solution.

As such, you’ll have to be the original owner of the iPhone, and you’ll need to have all your details if you want to be able to carry out this method. You can try to go about this method, but the chances are strong that you’ll give up soon, in which case you should revisit some methods mentioned earlier.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-2"><a href="#Conclusion-2" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>As you can see, there are a lot of options with which to <strong>unlock iCloud-locked iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;iPod</strong>.

Of course, this is mainly made by Apple through iCloud or Apple ID. This system is designed to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access. This is what makes Apple’s devices highly secure and sought after.</p><p>However, a common challenge arises when you acquire a second-hand iPhone or iPad. You may find it’s connected to the previous owner’s iCloud account through an Activation Lock. This situation can be a significant hurdle, rendering the Apple iPhone 13 device almost unusable. As you may expect, this article will help you <strong>remove the iCloud Activation Lock</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg"                      alt="activation lock page ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 13 device to a specific Apple ID.</p><h3 id="Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock</h3><p>Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.</p><p>In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password"><a href="#Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password"></a>Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password</h2><p>If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 13 device, learning <strong>how to remove iCloud Activation Lock</strong> is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.</p><p>If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 13 device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 13 device. If the Apple iPhone 13 device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to <strong>Settings &gt;</strong> Tap on the profile on top of the app &gt; <strong>Sign Out</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-02.jpg"                      alt="icloud sign out button"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten your Apple ID, it can be recovered by signing in with your Apple ID account. Then, click the <strong>Forgot Password</strong> button. You may need to answer security questions or receive a code on a trusted device to complete this process.</p><h3 id="Removing-Activation-Lock-via-iCloud-For-Offline-Devices"><a href="#Removing-Activation-Lock-via-iCloud-For-Offline-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)"></a>Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)</h3><p>Alternatively, you can remove the iCloud account by following the steps below.

This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don’t have the credentials using third-party software.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vsQWFTA1UY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                >safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool"></a>Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool</h2><p>Sometimes, getting some penny spent is a great idea.

When the Activation Lock is enabled, the Apple iPhone SE device requires the owner’s Apple ID and password to set up or restore the Apple iPhone SE device, making it difficult for thieves to use or sell stolen iPhones. The Activation Lock ensures the Apple iPhone SE device’s data remains secure and can only be accessed by the rightful owner.</p><p>Regardless of whether you erase your device, Activation Lock can keep on preventing anybody from reactivating your device without your consent. Regardless of whether your device is stolen, the other person will require either your device password or your Apple ID credentials to use the phone. Even if they try resetting your device through DFU mode, they will not have the option to reactivate and utilize it without <strong>Apple iPhone SE iCloud unlock</strong>.</p><p>However, it can create a problem for you if you’re the second owner of this device. So, if you bought this phone from someone else, you must remove the lock first. In such cases, you will need <strong>Apple iPhone SE iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-SE-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-SE-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone SE iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone SE iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature designed to protect iPhones from unauthorized use. However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone SE locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let’s dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone SE.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password"></a>Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password</h3><p>The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone SE and ask for their Apple ID and password. To <strong>bypass Apple iPhone SE</strong>, you need to have some data in hand:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you’re the second owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone SE passcode.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="enter icloud details"                ></p><p>After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone SE iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone SE device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.</li></ul><p>However, if you see the Apple iPhone SE passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone SE device without the iCloud account.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone SE device set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely"></a>Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely</h3><p>If the iPhone’s first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it’s time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.</p><p>However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.</p><p>So, if it’s not a stolen device, you don’t need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone SE device and <strong>bypass Apple iPhone SE</strong> by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Apple iPhone SE devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick your Apple iPhone SE model from there.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked. It’s as simple as that.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="remove or erase"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device’s features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone SE, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.</p><p><strong>How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?</strong></p><p>A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone SE device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone SE.</p><p><strong>Limitations of this Features</strong></p><p>When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn’t true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.</p><p>The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Proceed” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page.

This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2.

In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone SE device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About.

However, there will be challenges if you have bought a used iPhone and if the owner has not logged out of his account on that phone. If you are in this situation, then you will need to either contact the previous owner or be locked out of your phone.

This is a great feature if you are a victim of theft and would like to remotely lock your phone to be sure that it cannot be accessed by the thief or anyone else.</p><p>You can follow the steps below to remotely lock your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the “Find My iPhone” on your browser while locking your phone remotely.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Log in with your credentials.
