This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don’t have the credentials using third-party software.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vsQWFTA1UY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2027181/19272" target="_top" id="2027181">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2027181" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2027181/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool"></a>Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool</h2><p>Sometimes, getting some penny spent is a great idea.

One way to unlock iCloud locked phone is to bypass the iCloud activation lock by following the steps below</p><p>Step 1. Take your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and while on the “Activate iPhone” screen, press the home button and then press the “Wi-Fi” settings. Next to the “Wi-Fi” symbol, tap on “i”. Now you need to change the existing DNS settings. The DNS settings you need to type are as follows:</p><ol><li>If you are in the USA type in 104.154.51.7</li><li>In Europe, type 104.155.28.90</li><li>In Asia, type 104.155.220.58</li><li>The rest of the world, please type in 78.109.17.60</li></ol><p>Step 2. Tap on the “Back” button then click “Done”. Next, click “Activation help”. Once you have done that, you will see a message that says: You have successfully connected to my server.” If you tap on the menu, you will be able to access different iCloud services such as iCloud Locked User Chat, Mail, Social, Maps, Video, YouTube, Audia, and games, among others.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1885947/19272" target="_top" id="1885947">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1885947" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1885947/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-unlock-iCloud-lock-by-Apple-iPhone-Unlock"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-unlock-iCloud-lock-by-Apple-iPhone-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to unlock iCloud lock by Apple iPhone Unlock"></a>Part 4: How to unlock iCloud lock by Apple iPhone Unlock</h2><p>Sometimes it may not be possible to completely unlock your iCloud Lock. For instance, the free method of unlocking your iCloud Lock only works on iOS 9 and iOS 8 for iPhones. Anything else will not work properly. Moreover, you may not be able to know how to unlock iCloud lock-free if you are in certain countries. That is when you can think of using the Official iPhone Unlock service which will completely unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without any hassle. The iCloud Activation Lock Removal tool will quickly remove the iCloud activation lock from the previous owner’s account. In short, this is an easy and seamless tool for removing the iCloud lock to set your own.</p><p>Step 1 - Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Apple iPhone unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by clicking on this link.</p><p>Step 2 - Enter the IMEI&#x2F;Serial number of your device and send it.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14720745007162.jpg" alt="Enter your IMEI/Serial number"></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Step 3 - Just wait for a confirmation message telling you that the iCloud Lock has been removed.</p><p>Step 4 - Now create a new iCloud account and start using your device</p><p>This tool works on all iPhone 6, 6+, 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4, and iPad 4, 3, 2 Air 2 and also works on iOS, and it doesn’t matter why you are unlocking it from.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111965/7443" target="_top" id="2111965">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111965" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111965/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Wrap-it-up"><a href="#Wrap-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it up"></a>Wrap it up</h3><p>Unlike the free iCloud Lock unlock solution, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iCloud Activation Lock Removal) tool provides a permanent solution to the problem of how to unlock iCloud locked irrespective of your country.

Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information.

As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.</p><p>Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don’t know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.</p><p>Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>The tool doesn’t require tech skills</li><li>It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices</li><li>Supports a wide range of hardware platforms</li><li>It is not possible to exploit remotely</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Jailbreaking older devices is limited</li><li>A reboot won’t save them</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?</h2><p>You may consider using Checkra1n if you are looking for a method to bypass the iCloud activation lock.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?</h2><p>Many third-party services claim to offer solutions to bypass iCloud activation using the IMEI number. These services propose to unlock iCloud activation by altering or manipulating the IMEI number. They promise a free and swift solution to bypass iCloud activation. Follow these steps to bypass iCloud activation using IMEI:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin with finding your device’s IMEI number. You can do it by using the *#06# code. Otherwise, you can get it from the phone box or in iPhone “Settings.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-5.jpg"                      alt="search for imei"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now access a reliable iCloud Activation lock bypassing via IMEI number service.

Once you confirm that your iOS device has been successfully jailbroken, the process initiates automatically to remove the Activation Lock. The progress is indicated by a bar displayed on the screen. Upon completion of the process, a message will appear in the window indicating the conclusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-9.png"                      alt="jailbreak and unlock ios device"                ></p><p><strong><em>For iOS 15.0~16.3</em></strong></p><p><strong>Step 1: Navigate to the Unlock Now Screen</strong></p><p>Launch Dr.Fone, tap “Toolbox,” and access “Screen Unlock” to proceed.

Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner"></a>1. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner</h3><p>For an <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong>, you’ll require a couple of significant pieces of data:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode in mind.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="owners apple id"                ></p><p>After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, if you see the lock screen passcode, you can type the passcode and set up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device without the Apple ID.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device completely set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.</p><h3 id="2-Use-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2. Use DNS Bypass"></a>2. Use DNS Bypass</h3><p><strong>What is DNS?</strong></p><p>Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.</p><p>You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can’t utilize the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong> via DNS bypass.</p><p><strong>Steps to Follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button&gt; More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:</p></li><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You will see the next page choice; don’t click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Look down the page, go to the menu and set up your applications, music, camera, and so forth.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137226/26400" target="_top" id="2137226">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137226" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137226/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Emergency-Call"><a href="#3-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="3.

It is among the clearest and speediest procedures to remove your iCloud account. The guidelines underneath will show you how to unlock your iCloud free by utilizing the Emergency Call technique:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Select your preferred language and current region.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, on the iCloud activation screen, press the home button three times to begin on Voice Command and multiple times to close down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Again push on a home button, and this time select Emergency Calls.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, you need to key in *#96274825*0000*1#. Then press the call button multiple times.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Then, you need to modify the last digit from 1 to 2 and repeatedly press the call button.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Perform this strategy once more. When you adhere to every one of the guidelines, press the back button, and turn around to the starting screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now, just like you did before, select your language and country. After picking it, you will see the bypass screen.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock"></a>4.

While ensuring the protection of all the data of your device, it offers a unique set of security-enhanced environment that helps you manage all your data over a single identification protocol. This identification protocol interconnects all the Apple devices with each other. Such an example can be taken from the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max that interconnects its structure with your Apple devices that are operating under a similar Apple ID. Under such circumstances where you accidentally lock your Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud, several techniques can be adapted to cover the issue efficiently. To regain your access to the iCloud of your Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max along with the data it holds, this article provides you with a set of instructions that can be implemented to unlock the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/unlock-apple-watch-icloud.jpg"                      alt="unlock apple watch icloud"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-About-iCloud-activation-lock-on-Apple-Watch-Or-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#Part-1-About-iCloud-activation-lock-on-Apple-Watch-Or-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. About iCloud activation lock on Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max"></a>Part 1. About iCloud activation lock on Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</h2><p>Apple presented a unique security system with a single identification tool to operate with. The Activation Lock is considered as the core of the complete system under which the associated devices function. Major Apple connections, including iCloud, iTunes, and other identification-oriented features, require the basic Activation Lock. Furthermore, this system is not restricted to smartphones and tablets but leads onto other Apple Devices such as the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>The Find My service presented by Apple is taken further with the Activation Lock. This not only protects the data and the attached applications but prevents the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices from being wiped out and re-sold to the black market. Hence, if any user intends to change the settings of the Apple device without having it disconnected from the previous Apple ID, it is far more than impossible to be executed successfully. Activation Lock ensures that all the data present on your device is typically protected and kept safe from nefarious hands. Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max operates over the similar Apple ID that you have used across other devices, making its recovery and removal quite similar to the conventional methods that are adopted by people throughout the market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-loked-apple-watch.png"                      alt="icloud loked apple watch"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://imp.i357552.net/c/5597632/999558/11832" target="_top" id="999558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/11832-999558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.i357552.net/i/5597632/999558/11832"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-determine-if-your-Apple-Watch-Or-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-is-iCloud-locked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-determine-if-your-Apple-Watch-Or-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-is-iCloud-locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.</p><p>Sign in to the iCloud account&gt; Go to “Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max”&gt; Select each and every device under this tab&gt; click “Erase iPhone.” Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we’ll proceed to the next step, which is to click the “Next” tab. Once we’ve done this, a new tab with “Remove Account” will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.</p><h3 id="Visit-an-Authorised-Apple-Store"><a href="#Visit-an-Authorised-Apple-Store" class="headerlink" title="Visit an Authorised Apple Store"></a>Visit an Authorised Apple Store</h3><p>You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it’s still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Jailbreak-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Jailbreak-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone</h2><p>You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu.

Apple has placed the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.</p><p>Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer"><a href="#Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Activation Lock Primer"></a>Part 1: Activation Lock Primer</h2><p>Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.</p><p>Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135354/19272" target="_top" id="2135354">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135354" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="250" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135354/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max)"></a>Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max)</h2><p>An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone but forgot to erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device before submitting and consequently, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to make it useable again.

This means that if you have the Apple ID credentials that were used to enable Activation Lock, you can simply use them to remove Activation Lock and unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max just as easily. However, things get increasingly difficult from that point on if you do not have Apple ID credentials. You can use iCloud to erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and remove the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device from the Apple ID account it is connected to, remotely. If you are an IT administrator deploying Microsoft services, you can use Microsoft Intune to get around the Activation Lock easily.</p><p>If you are an iPhone 5 to iPhone X user, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is available as an option to bypass Activation Lock on the iPhone. It should be noted that this process will cause the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to be “rooted”, meaning that data services and iCloud will not function and phone calls cannot be made from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.</p><h2 id="How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-and-iPad"><a href="#How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad"></a>How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad</h2><p>There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.</p><p>With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple"><a href="#Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple"></a>Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple</h2><p>In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device happens to be the real owner, then he&#x2F;she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.</p><p>This approach, however, has a downside. It’s only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.</p><h2 id="Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock"><a href="#Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock"></a>Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock</h2><p>One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

In such cases, you want to open an iCloud-locked device.</p><p>Therefore, this article will tell you the best <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong> techniques. It has both quicker and more permanent solutions to <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>. So, keep following this article until the end to find a permanent solution for your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-iCloud-Activation-Lock-in-iPhone11-12"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-iCloud-Activation-Lock-in-iPhone11-12" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is iCloud Activation Lock in iPhone11&#x2F;12?"></a>Part 1: What is iCloud Activation Lock in iPhone11&#x2F;12?</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature implemented by Apple on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and other iOS devices. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device by linking it to the owner’s Apple ID and iCloud account. When the Activation Lock is enabled, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device requires the owner’s Apple ID and password to set up or restore the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, making it difficult for thieves to use or sell stolen iPhones. The Activation Lock ensures the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s data remains secure and can only be accessed by the rightful owner.</p><p>Regardless of whether you erase your device, Activation Lock can keep on preventing anybody from reactivating your device without your consent. Regardless of whether your device is stolen, the other person will require either your device password or your Apple ID credentials to use the phone. Even if they try resetting your device through DFU mode, they will not have the option to reactivate and utilize it without <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud unlock</strong>.</p><p>However, it can create a problem for you if you’re the second owner of this device. So, if you bought this phone from someone else, you must remove the lock first. In such cases, you will need <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature designed to protect iPhones from unauthorized use. However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let’s dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password"></a>Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password</h3><p>The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and ask for their Apple ID and password. To <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>, you need to have some data in hand:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you’re the second owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="enter icloud details"                ></p><p>After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.</li></ul><p>However, if you see the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device without the iCloud account.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely"></a>Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely</h3><p>If the iPhone’s first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it’s time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.</p><p>However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.</p><p>So, if it’s not a stolen device, you don’t need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max model from there.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked. It’s as simple as that.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="remove or erase"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device’s features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.</p><p><strong>How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?</strong></p><p>A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p><strong>Limitations of this Features</strong></p><p>When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn’t true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.</p><p>The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Proceed” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect with Wi-Fi, search for the “I” icon near the Wi-Fi tab.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Disconnect the Wi-Fi, go to “Connection Settings,” and snap “Forget this Network.”</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “I” icon and enter a DNS server IP address. You can browse the IP addresses below:</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-3.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other regions: 78.100.17.60</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Presently, click the “Back” choice on the left half of your screen, turn on Wi-Fi, select your network from there, and enter your code.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="activate iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6.</strong> Click “Next Page” and snap “Back” to enter the iCloud bypass screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7.</strong> Your device will unlock, and you can access all its features now.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1886015/19272" target="_top" id="1886015">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1886015" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1886015/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-quickly-with-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-For-iPhone-5S-to-iPhone-X-SE-1-running-iOS-12-0-to-iOS-16-6"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-quickly-with-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-For-iPhone-5S-to-iPhone-X-SE-1-running-iOS-12-0-to-iOS-16-6" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock quickly with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (For iPhone 5S to iPhone X&#x2F;SE 1 running iOS 12.0 to iOS 16.6)"></a>Bonus Tip: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock quickly with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (For iPhone 5S to iPhone X&#x2F;SE 1 running iOS 12.0 to iOS 16.6)</h2><p>Because of the limitations of iCloud DNS bypass and the cons of the other mentioned ways, many people tend to find a permanent solution to their issue.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> With over 250 million players, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is a third-person shooter that has taken the world by storm—and for good reason. Its vibrant colors, memorable animations, and constant updates serve to keep gameplay fresh for returning players, but remain stable enough so as not to disrupt new players’ experiences.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Z5kydB0kP2A67yJxqmRGCP6KuT8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_04-f788a639837845a9aead0db474cbc72d.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134224/18498" target="_top" id="2134224">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134224" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134224/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way"><a href="#Plot-None-but-it’s-better-that-way" class="headerlink" title="Plot: None, but it’s better that way"></a><strong>Plot: None, but it’s better that way</strong></h2><p> Fortnite is plot light, a battle royale designed like the Hunger Games in that it drops players onto a map with one singular goal: survive to the end of the match and be the only player, or squad, left standing. Instead of a continuous story mode, players experience dramatic shifts in the game mechanics and the map season-to-season.</p><p> These include new explorable areas, changes to existing areas, weapon buffs, and new in-game mechanics, such as fishing or the addition of boats. Past seasons have included airplanes, snowboards, mechs and more—so who knows what future seasons will hold. The Battle Royale mode can become a little repetitive over time, but that’s why new seasons are important. They change up the pace of the game and reinvigorate the interest of players. The one guarantee is that each new season brings change, and with the dawn of Chapter 2, it’s clear that Epic Games hasn’t lost their touch for re-imagining their game.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/u0p3ac203yN2fyC3DvKLcXMqdAY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fornite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_02-8da4487c33dc4aed81eabc862664a1f8.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137411/7443" target="_top" id="2137411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137411/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play"><a href="#Gameplay-Simple-for-easy-pick-up-and-play" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play"></a><strong>Gameplay: Simple for easy pick up and play</strong></h2><p> To win the Victory Royale, players compete solo, with a partner, or in squads of three to four people. Games are quick, lasting anywhere from 15-20 minutes once you get the hang of things, although it’s always possible to die earlier. The game starts by placing 100 players on Spawn Island while it queues up the teams. Once ready, everyone on the island is transported onto a Battle Bus which floats over the Fortnite map, allowing players to leap down and begin their quest to the top.</p><p> What’s better—not only is the Battle Royale mode free, but cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><p> Play is simple: loot chests, explore areas while scavenging for weapons and ammunition, chug potions to gain shields, and use your pickaxe to harvest materials by breaking down the world around you. Essentially, do whatever it takes to gear up fast and take down other players. With five item slots available, it’s important to grab at least one weapon (though we’d recommend grabbing several if you can), but the remaining slots can be used to carry healing items, potions, fishing reels, and other gear—but don’t dally too long deciding because the storm is coming.</p><p> The storm is an ever-encroaching threat that closes over set intervals and deals damage that increases over time to players trapped within its boundaries, forcing everyone closer together as the safe zone shrinks. The last team standing will claim the Victory Royale for themselves.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Good-campy-fun"><a href="#Graphics-Good-campy-fun" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Good, campy fun"></a><strong>Graphics: Good, campy fun</strong></h2><p> Fortnite’s graphics are campy, oversaturated, and brightly-colored fun making them a treat to look at. Unlike competitors such as PUBG or Apex Legends, Fortnite’s graphics trade realism for cartoonish, exaggerated features. When combined with the emotes and skins earned throughout the game, these can create some very entertaining in-game visuals.</p><p> It’s worth noting that DirectX 12 support is officially here for PC users, which means that people playing on higher quality graphics cards should see a more consistent gameplay experience thanks to an increased and more stable frame rate. If your system is older, you can play on reduced settings, but it does make the picture choppy and difficult to follow. It’ll get the job done, but we wouldn’t recommend it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/1EGFvaMlK-nV8KKnng7WcI-X7iI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_BattleRoyale_StandardMode_03-aff88589c9a04d05a9663f5a75975706.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2036481/19272" target="_top" id="2036481">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2036481" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2036481/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more"><a href="#Building-Mechanics-Build-build-and-build-some-more" class="headerlink" title="Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more"></a><strong>Building Mechanics: Build, build and build some more</strong></h2><p> A battle royale it may be, but Fortnite’s unique building mechanics truly set the game apart and turn the heat up a notch. All that harvesting you’re doing will pay off, because for every 10 stacks of a material such as wood or stone you have, you can build a structure. Be aware that durability and build time will vary based on the selected material, so take time to experiment and find what techniques work best for you.</p><p> Building is as important as shooting, so it’s essential to learn the basics. Players can build floors, stairs, roofs, and walls, which can be used either in defense or, for the imaginative player, in offense. These structures help players gain the higher ground on the battlefield, access hard-to-reach map locations, and buy time for healing items or shielding potions. It seems counterintuitive to be building anything in a battle royale game, but within moments structures will cobble itself together before a player’s eyes.</p><p> For the more casual player, these building controls can be found on the keyboard, but binding the building keys to unused mouse buttons can quickly become an asset on the battlefield where every second counts. A seamless defense can be the difference between victory and defeat.</p><h2 id="Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass"><a href="#Seasons-The-down-and-dirty-on-the-Battle-Pass" class="headerlink" title="Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass"></a><strong>Seasons: The down and dirty on the Battle Pass</strong></h2><p> The seasonal Battle Pass system offers rewards to players as they gain experience in the game, a change from the previous system Chapter 1 used which relied on leveling up through Battle Stars earned from Weekly Challenges. The shift to experience-based leveling feels much more intuitive. And honestly, it’s fun to watch the experience bar increase during the match, although it’d be better if you could toggle its presence to collapse or display in the HUD.</p><p> If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer.</p><p> Just like Chapter 1, Chapter 2’s Battle Pass offers both free and premium rewards. This is in addition to the microtransactions offered for cosmetic upgrades in the Fortnite Shop. These rewards are purely cosmetic, but offer big personalities. They vary from new skins, such as rescue workers or monsters made from Slurp Juice (the solution which shields players from damage), new gliders for launching onto the map, new pickaxes and backpacks, as well as silly dances and emotes for goofy fun.</p><p> To access the premium rewards, players need to buy into the Battle Pass by purchasing in-game currency known as V-Bucks. The Battle Pass costs 950 V-Bucks or $9.50. If you value cosmetic upgrades, it’s a fun add-on. If cosmetics aren’t as important to you, the Battle Pass is easily a feature you can skip, but if you like having a variety of goals you can work towards and earn, then it’s a no brainer. Each Battle Pass is only valid for the season in which they are bought, so if you’re joining late in the season consider if it’s worth it to invest in a reward system you may not be able to complete.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Ock_qOb167XfWuEIuPpuFC0DpUQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Fortnite_Battle-Royale_Standard-Mode_05-95fe04b07a934bdbbcf8ae58496c736c.jpg"                      alt="Fortnite Battle Royale"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety"><a href="#Modes-Limited-time-and-alternative-game-modes-for-variety" class="headerlink" title="Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety"></a><strong>Modes: Limited-time and alternative game modes for variety</strong></h2><p> As if the game mechanics and the cosmetics weren’t thrilling enough, Epic Games takes the shake-ups a step further by offering alternative modes, limited-time game modes, and events with unique rewards.</p><p> These include permanent alternative modes like Team Rumble, which features teams of 50 versus 50 who compete for an elimination count to win the match, or crossover events between DC, Marvel, Stranger Things, John Wick, the NFL, and more. These crossover events aren’t just combat-based—Epic Games has gone as far as hosting a virtual concert on its servers with Marshmello, a popular DJ and Fortnite fan himself. It may seem strange, but Epic consistently seeks out ways to reinvent the game and push the boundaries of what video games are capable of handling. This ensures that Fortnite remains fresh and interesting.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner.</p><h2 id="Price-Free-to-play"><a href="#Price-Free-to-play" class="headerlink" title="Price: Free to play"></a><strong>Price: Free to play</strong></h2><p> The only decision players need to make is whether or not they want to pick up the Battle Pass, which retails for 950 V-Bucks ($9.50). Otherwise,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/game-play-and-streaming-4781449" >Fortnite Battle Royale <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is free and available on almost every major platform: PC&#x2F;Mac, Xbox One, PS4, iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch. What’s better—cross-platform gameplay is also supported, so you can pick up and play with friends anywhere, anytime.</p><h2 id="Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale"><a href="#Apex-Legends-vs-Fortnite-Battle-Royale" class="headerlink" title="Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale"></a><strong>Apex Legends vs. Fortnite Battle Royale</strong></h2><p> Battle royale games have seen a lot of shake-up in the field lately, with the latest challenger arriving in February 2019 thanks to Respawn Entertainment’s<a class="link"   href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends" >Apex Legends <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Apex Legends is a first-person shooter meets battle royale game where 60 players are dropped onto a map competing with squads of three for domination.</p><p> Now boasting a player base of 70 million people, Apex Legends is quickly catching on Steam. All around, it feels like a more adult version of Fortnite. Instead of oversaturated, cartoonish graphics, goofy dances, and emotes, players are greeted by a more refined world that’s a glorious clash of fire and ice, and a graphics engine reminiscent of the Titanfall franchise. Running around lava fields, ziplining through ice craters, and skydiving into the skyscrapers of Capitol City is a real treat. One of the best parts of the map is the train system which spans the island, enabling quick travel between locations—and unexpected attacks of opportunity.</p><p> In addition to its fantastic graphics, Apex Legends offers a sophisticated ping system that communicates looting, enemy behavior, good-natured jibes, and movement tactics, among other call-outs. It’s a system Fortnite has even shifted into adopting, in a more limited manner. Unlike Fortnite’s weapon system, Apex Legends includes weapon attachments for additional customization options. These range from scopes, extended magazines, hop-ups to alter rate of fire, stocks, and barrel stabilizers.</p><p> Recently reaching its third season, Apex Legends offers its own Battle Pass for 950 Apex Coins or $9.50, although the rewards don’t seem nearly as enticing as those offered by Fortnite. It too offers both free rewards and paid rewards for players who buy into the Battle Pass, but the free rewards are few and far between. Many of the player skins and weapon skins are fun, but their presence seems counterintuitive—particularly when you consider that you rarely see the player skins you earn in Apex Legends thanks to its first-person shooter style. The only time you can appreciate them, aside from the loading screens, are when you perform finishing moves, revive a player, or skydive, which seems strange for something you’re able to customize as well as purchase additional cosmetics for through microtransactions.</p><p> If you love earning a variety of rewards, are intrigued by building mechanics, or just appreciate a casual game you can pick up and play, Fortnite’s Battle Royale is the clear winner. If you’re looking for a more advanced game, however, Apex Legends is an appealing challenger and well worth a second look—and just like Fortnite, Apex Legends is free to play.

Keep reading for our full product review.</em></p><p> Smartwatches are incredible devices, and the Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music is no exception. It’s remarkable how much advanced tech is crammed below the glass of this diminutive device. I ran it through its paces to see if it can stand out in a crowded and competitive niche.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Design-Attractive-and-minimalistic"><a href="#Design-Attractive-and-minimalistic" class="headerlink" title="Design: Attractive and minimalistic"></a><strong>Design: Attractive and minimalistic</strong></h2><p> At first glance, you could be forgiven for not realizing that the Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music is a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/an-introduction-to-smart-watches-3441381" >smartwatch <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . Its round, modern, minimalist design is attractive but subtle. The face of the watch is made of scratch-resistant Corning Gorilla Glass 3, the case is built of rugged polymer, and the strap is silicone. This rugged construction comes with a waterproofing rating of 5 atmospheres (ATM), which means it’s rated down to 163 feet. However, it’s worth noting that this watch isn’t intended for diving use.</p><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music is operated using both the touch screen and a single button on the side. A short press of the button switches between the app currently in use and the watch face, while a long press brings up a circular menu with shortcuts to menus and apps. Most navigation is controlled via the touchscreen.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/M4iaS5RgiaubncJH8F-ZLVQQ8Po=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivoactive-3-Music-Smart-Watch-2-a0cd2c48cc0d423d85a3dc1f7e677160.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Comfort-On-the-small-side"><a href="#Comfort-On-the-small-side" class="headerlink" title="Comfort: On the small side"></a><strong>Comfort: On the small side</strong></h2><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music is perfectly comfortable if you have small or medium-sized wrists, but the included band was a little small for my extra-large 9-inch wrists. Personally, I couldn’t stand to wear it all day long due to this sizing issue. In order to fully test the watch, I handed it off to a friend with smaller 7-inch wrists, who reported it was extremely comfortable.</p><p> The size of the watch itself is reasonably compact and comparable to larger traditional watches. It weighs only 39 grams, light enough to not feel like a burden.</p><p> The included band was a little small for my extra-large 9-inch wrists.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/2139558/4704" target="_top" id="2139558">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-2139558" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/2139558/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Setup-Process-Fairly-straightforward"><a href="#Setup-Process-Fairly-straightforward" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Fairly straightforward"></a><strong>Setup Process: Fairly straightforward</strong></h2><p> Getting started with the Vivoactive 3 Music is reasonably easy, though it did take me some time after connecting to my phone to get through all the necessary permissions and connections it requires. There were updates to install, and I needed to create an account with Garmin. I also downloaded Spotify and connected the Vivoactive 3 to my wireless earbuds. Note that you need to connect to Wi-Fi to download music via Spotify or another app.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2087239/19272" target="_top" id="2087239">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2087239" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2087239/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Performance-Hit-and-miss"><a href="#Performance-Hit-and-miss" class="headerlink" title="Performance: Hit and miss"></a><strong>Performance: Hit and miss</strong></h2><p> When I started using the Vivoactive 3 Music, I found the heart rate monitor to be less than reliable. Sometimes it reported over a hundred BPM while I was sitting on the couch. However, it appears my large wrists are the culprit here, as it reported heart rate more accurately when used by other people with smaller wrists.</p><p> The information collected by the watch can all be found in granular detail in the Garmin Connect app on your phone. The watch has special settings for a wide variety of activities from walking to swimming. It’s quite accurate at distance tracking, step counts, and sleep tracking.</p><p> The 1.2-inch screen has an acceptable resolution of 240 x 240 pixels. It looks fine, and I never had issues with the quality of the image displayed, but it’s quite dim and difficult to see in bright conditions. The touchscreen interface is responsive, though a bit laggy, and it doesn’t always automatically brighten the display when you flip your wrist to check the time.</p><p>The touchscreen interface is responsive, though a bit laggy.</p><h2 id="Battery-Variable-duration"><a href="#Battery-Variable-duration" class="headerlink" title="Battery: Variable duration"></a><strong>Battery: Variable duration</strong></h2><p> How long the battery in the Vivoactive 3 Music lasts depends entirely on how it’s used. If you only use its smartwatch capabilities occasionally then it’s good for a week at a time. However, when I made use of GPS, music, and other power-intensive features, it would run out in less than a full day of use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/NdBt6UHu7uQUfRZfJN5BzwIEad8=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivoactive-3-Music-Smart-Watch-3-18b432ab56ac4ef284ba74ffd1ec7f82.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Software-Proprietary-ecosystem"><a href="#Software-Proprietary-ecosystem" class="headerlink" title="Software: Proprietary ecosystem"></a><strong>Software: Proprietary ecosystem</strong></h2><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music utilizes Garmin’s proprietary operating system and app store. I was impressed by the wide variety of apps available in the Garmin IQ store. There are numerous downloadable watch faces (I particularly loved one with a Star Trek theme), multiple music apps including Spotify and Amazon Music, maps, tools, and games.</p><p> Though the quality seems to vary, this range of apps opens up a world of customization. I can’t really recommend gaming on the Vivoactive 3 Music though—the screen is just too small, and it’s hard to control anything even as simple as Tetris. However, there are situations where having a simple game on your watch would be really desirable to pass the time, even if it’s hard to control. Keep in mind, though, that games and apps eat away at battery quickly when used actively and frequently.</p><p> You don’t need to lug your phone along with you to use many of the features of this watch.</p><p> The Vivoactive 3 Music also includes<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/most-popular-mobile-payment-apps-2373179" >contactless payment <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> through Garmin Pay, which supports a wide range of major cards and banks. It’s a cool feature and is especially desirable from a hygiene perspective as well as for ease and simplicity.</p><p> Of course, the standout feature of the Vivoactive 3 Music is that it can store and play music, which is all that separates the Vivoactive 3 from the Vivoactive 3 Music. It can store up to 500 songs, and I downloaded several albums via Spotify to listen to while out and about. The watch connects to wireless headphones via Bluetooth, which along with the built-in GPS and Wi-Fi means that in many cases you don’t need to lug your phone along with you to use many of the watch’s features.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/dALT4qb1vS9VNEvePqYoZlqXX0s=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Garmin-Vivoactive-3-Music-Smart-Watch-4-a84ac637f7034353bffd90856070a7d8.jpg"                      alt="Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Price-Reasonable-value"><a href="#Price-Reasonable-value" class="headerlink" title="Price: Reasonable value"></a><strong>Price: Reasonable value</strong></h2><p> At its MSRP of $249 the Garmin Vivoactive 3 Music is acceptably priced for the features it packs in.

Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it.

It is designed to prevent unauthorized access to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device by linking it to the owner’s Apple ID and iCloud account. When the Activation Lock is enabled, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device requires the owner’s Apple ID and password to set up or restore the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, making it difficult for thieves to use or sell stolen iPhones. The Activation Lock ensures the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device’s data remains secure and can only be accessed by the rightful owner.</p><p>Regardless of whether you erase your device, Activation Lock can keep on preventing anybody from reactivating your device without your consent. Regardless of whether your device is stolen, the other person will require either your device password or your Apple ID credentials to use the phone. Even if they try resetting your device through DFU mode, they will not have the option to reactivate and utilize it without <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud unlock</strong>.</p><p>However, it can create a problem for you if you’re the second owner of this device. So, if you bought this phone from someone else, you must remove the lock first.

However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let’s dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password"></a>Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password</h3><p>The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and ask for their Apple ID and password. To <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>, you need to have some data in hand:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you’re the second owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="enter icloud details"                ></p><p>After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.</li></ul><p>However, if you see the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device without the iCloud account.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely"></a>Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely</h3><p>If the iPhone’s first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it’s time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.</p><p>However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.</p><p>So, if it’s not a stolen device, you don’t need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max model from there.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked. It’s as simple as that.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="remove or erase"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device’s features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.</p><p><strong>How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?</strong></p><p>A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p><strong>Limitations of this Features</strong></p><p>When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn’t true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.</p><p>The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Proceed” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect with Wi-Fi, search for the “I” icon near the Wi-Fi tab.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Disconnect the Wi-Fi, go to “Connection Settings,” and snap “Forget this Network.”</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “I” icon and enter a DNS server IP address.

The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.</p><p>The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.</p><p>A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13&#x2F;.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.</p><p>If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997657/19272" target="_top" id="1997657">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997657" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997657/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?"></a>Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is lost or stolen, one of the first steps you should take is to erase the data remotely.

In such cases, you will need <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature designed to protect iPhones from unauthorized use. However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let’s dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password"></a>Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password</h3><p>The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and ask for their Apple ID and password. To <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>, you need to have some data in hand:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you’re the second owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="enter icloud details"                ></p><p>After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.</li></ul><p>However, if you see the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device without the iCloud account.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135366/19272" target="_top" id="2135366">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135366" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135366/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely"></a>Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely</h3><p>If the iPhone’s first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it’s time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.</p><p>However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.</p><p>So, if it’s not a stolen device, you don’t need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong> by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max model from there.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked. It’s as simple as that.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="remove or erase"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135411/19272" target="_top" id="2135411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="180" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135411/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device’s features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.</p><p><strong>How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?</strong></p><p>A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p><strong>Limitations of this Features</strong></p><p>When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn’t true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.</p><p>The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Proceed” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect with Wi-Fi, search for the “I” icon near the Wi-Fi tab.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Disconnect the Wi-Fi, go to “Connection Settings,” and snap “Forget this Network.”</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “I” icon and enter a DNS server IP address. You can browse the IP addresses below:</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-3.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other regions: 78.100.17.60</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Presently, click the “Back” choice on the left half of your screen, turn on Wi-Fi, select your network from there, and enter your code.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="activate iphone"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137210/26400" target="_top" id="2137210">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137210" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137210/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><ul><li><strong>Step 6.</strong> Click “Next Page” and snap “Back” to enter the iCloud bypass screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7.</strong> Your device will unlock, and you can access all its features now.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-quickly-with-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-For-iPhone-5S-to-iPhone-X-SE-1-running-iOS-12-0-to-iOS-16-6"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-quickly-with-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-For-iPhone-5S-to-iPhone-X-SE-1-running-iOS-12-0-to-iOS-16-6" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock quickly with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (For iPhone 5S to iPhone X&#x2F;SE 1 running iOS 12.0 to iOS 16.6)"></a>Bonus Tip: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock quickly with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (For iPhone 5S to iPhone X&#x2F;SE 1 running iOS 12.0 to iOS 16.6)</h2><p>Because of the limitations of iCloud DNS bypass and the cons of the other mentioned ways, many people tend to find a permanent solution to their issue.

Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock"><a href="#Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?"></a>Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?</h2><p>Many people have always asked me if it’s possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/c/5597632/1576477/17382" target="_top" id="1576477">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17382-1576477" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://malaysia-healthcare-travel-council.pxf.io/i/5597632/1576477/17382"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner"><a href="#Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner"></a>Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner</h2><p>This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.</p><p>Sign in to the iCloud account&gt; Go to “Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max”&gt; Select each and every device under this tab&gt; click “Erase iPhone.” Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted.

The Activation Lock is considered as the core of the complete system under which the associated devices function. Major Apple connections, including iCloud, iTunes, and other identification-oriented features, require the basic Activation Lock. Furthermore, this system is not restricted to smartphones and tablets but leads onto other Apple Devices such as the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>The Find My service presented by Apple is taken further with the Activation Lock.

Activation Lock ensures that all the data present on your device is typically protected and kept safe from nefarious hands. Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max operates over the similar Apple ID that you have used across other devices, making its recovery and removal quite similar to the conventional methods that are adopted by people throughout the market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-loked-apple-watch.png"                      alt="icloud loked apple watch"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-determine-if-your-Apple-Watch-Or-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-is-iCloud-locked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-determine-if-your-Apple-Watch-Or-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-is-iCloud-locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

One method for unlocking an iCloud-locked device is to use the DNS bypass by following the steps underneath:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Take your iPad, and remember that on the “Activate iPhone” screen, press the home button and afterward press the “Wi-Fi” settings. Close to the Wi-Fi image, tap on the “I” symbol. Now you need to change the current DNS settings of your iPad. The DNS settings you want to type are as per the following:</p><ul><li>For users in the USA, type in 104.154.51.7</li><li>In Europe, type 104.155.28.90</li><li>In Asia, type 104.155.220.58</li><li>For other parts of the world, key in 78.109.17.60</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the “Back” button, then Done.

Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab.

While ensuring the protection of all the data of your device, it offers a unique set of security-enhanced environment that helps you manage all your data over a single identification protocol. This identification protocol interconnects all the Apple devices with each other. Such an example can be taken from the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max that interconnects its structure with your Apple devices that are operating under a similar Apple ID. Under such circumstances where you accidentally lock your Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud, several techniques can be adapted to cover the issue efficiently. To regain your access to the iCloud of your Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max along with the data it holds, this article provides you with a set of instructions that can be implemented to unlock the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with ease.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/unlock-apple-watch-icloud.jpg"                      alt="unlock apple watch icloud"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-About-iCloud-activation-lock-on-Apple-Watch-Or-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#Part-1-About-iCloud-activation-lock-on-Apple-Watch-Or-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. About iCloud activation lock on Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max"></a>Part 1. About iCloud activation lock on Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</h2><p>Apple presented a unique security system with a single identification tool to operate with. The Activation Lock is considered as the core of the complete system under which the associated devices function. Major Apple connections, including iCloud, iTunes, and other identification-oriented features, require the basic Activation Lock. Furthermore, this system is not restricted to smartphones and tablets but leads onto other Apple Devices such as the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>The Find My service presented by Apple is taken further with the Activation Lock. This not only protects the data and the attached applications but prevents the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices from being wiped out and re-sold to the black market. Hence, if any user intends to change the settings of the Apple device without having it disconnected from the previous Apple ID, it is far more than impossible to be executed successfully. Activation Lock ensures that all the data present on your device is typically protected and kept safe from nefarious hands. Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max operates over the similar Apple ID that you have used across other devices, making its recovery and removal quite similar to the conventional methods that are adopted by people throughout the market.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-loked-apple-watch.png"                      alt="icloud loked apple watch"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-determine-if-your-Apple-Watch-Or-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-is-iCloud-locked"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-determine-if-your-Apple-Watch-Or-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-is-iCloud-locked" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

You will learn in this post how to use Checkra1n iCloud bypass to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad.</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Checkra1n?"></a>Part 1: What is Checkra1n?</h2><p>Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.</p><p>Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don’t know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.</p><p>Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>The tool doesn’t require tech skills</li><li>It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices</li><li>Supports a wide range of hardware platforms</li><li>It is not possible to exploit remotely</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Jailbreaking older devices is limited</li><li>A reboot won’t save them</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2111994/7443" target="_top" id="2111994">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2111994" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2111994/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?</h2><p>You may consider using Checkra1n if you are looking for a method to bypass the iCloud activation lock.

This is starting to become a thing of the past as Apple implemented two-factor authentication to secure your Apple ID.</p><p>However, it’s not always perfect, as sometimes you need to get past two-factor authentication on your iCloud for various reasons. That’s why this article will teach you how to set it up and bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud yourself if you need to.

With Apple’s two unique ways to prove your identity, hackers will find it harder to access your personal and financial data.</p><p>Switching to two-factor authentication rather than two-step is becoming more common nowadays as security measures are more advanced.

Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To <strong>bypass iPad 3</strong> activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.</p><p>However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client.

Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your iPad, go to the “Settings” application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.</p><ul><li>If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to “iCloud” and sign out.</li><li>If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click “Sign Out.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="sign out"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will request the password to your Apple account.
