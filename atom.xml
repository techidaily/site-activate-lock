Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device stays connected with the past owner’s iCloud account.</p><p>It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials. However, we’ve discovered a few potential ways to <strong>bypass iPad 2&#x2F;3 and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</strong>. Also, we will introduce you to the best and expert bypass tool available in the market. Therefore, we strongly suggest you stay with us and download Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock. It is safe during the process. So, how about we begin?</p><p>Explore four practical methods to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock on your iPad 2&#x2F;3 and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. These solutions help you regain access to your device and its features, enabling you to enjoy your iPad without any restrictions.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner"><a href="#Method-1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner"></a>Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To <strong>bypass iPad 3</strong> activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.</p><p>However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your iPad, go to the “Settings” application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.</p><ul><li>If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to “iCloud” and sign out.</li><li>If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click “Sign Out.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="sign out"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will request the password to your Apple account.

However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.</p><p>With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple"><a href="#Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple"></a>Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple</h2><p>In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device happens to be the real owner, then he&#x2F;she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.</p><p>This approach, however, has a downside. It’s only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.</p><h2 id="Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock"><a href="#Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock"></a>Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock</h2><p>One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of the iCloud Activation Lock Removal process, you can easily bypass the iCloud Activation Lock and remove it completely from your device.

Well, if you just bought your phone from eBay, a second-hand vendor, or a friend, the chances are that its iCloud account is locked; that is, the new user will not able able to use it unless you know the username and password of the previous owner. Luckily, there is a way to unlock the iCloud account lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max if you cannot reach or convince the previous owner to reset the iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQckthGQm-8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max has an iCloud account lock on it?"></a>Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max has an iCloud account lock on it?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.</p><p>At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html" >iCloud Activation Lock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device’s files, features, and functions.</p><p>This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html" >a second-hand iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.</p><p>It doesn’t matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Whether you <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html" >jailbreak <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html" >reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked.

Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner"><a href="#Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner"></a>Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner</h2><p>This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.</p><p>Sign in to the iCloud account&gt; Go to “Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max”&gt; Select each and every device under this tab&gt; click “Erase iPhone.” Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we’ll proceed to the next step, which is to click the “Next” tab. Once we’ve done this, a new tab with “Remove Account” will emerge.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="New-Guide-How-To-Check-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-On-Your-Apple-iPhone-15"><a href="#New-Guide-How-To-Check-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-On-Your-Apple-iPhone-15" class="headerlink" title="New Guide: How To Check iCloud Activation Lock Status On Your Apple iPhone 15"></a>New Guide: How To Check iCloud Activation Lock Status On Your Apple iPhone 15</h2><p>Apple’s iOS is renowned for its robust security features, including the iCloud Activation Lock. This feature plays a crucial role in safeguarding Apple devices against unauthorized access. It’s a way to ensure that only the rightful owner can use and access the Apple iPhone 15 device. Originally designed as a theft deterrent, the iCloud Activation Lock on used Apple Devices becomes especially important when buying or selling second-hand phones.</p><p>Understanding the status of this lock is essential to ensure a secure and legitimate transaction. In this 2024 guide, you’ll dive into how to <strong>check the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong>. It’s a critical step for anyone involved in the trade of used Apple devices online or otherwise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone activation lock page"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Check-Activation-Lock-Status-Before-You-Buy-a-Used-Device"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Check-Activation-Lock-Status-Before-You-Buy-a-Used-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device"></a>Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device</h2><p>Understanding the iCloud Activation Lock is essential when purchasing a used Apple device. This security feature, designed by Apple, is activated when ‘Find My iPhone’ is enabled. It links the Apple iPhone 15 device to the owner’s Apple ID, preventing others from activating it without the owner’s permission. This lock is crucial for preventing unauthorized use of lost or stolen devices.</p><p>Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, <strong>checking the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong> is important. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Power on the Apple iPhone 15 device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone 15 device has been properly erased.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone lockscreen"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> <strong>If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone 15 device still needs to be fully erased. In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone 15 device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start setting up the Apple iPhone 15 device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone 15 device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> During the setup, if the Apple iPhone 15 device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone 15 device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone 15 device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.</li></ul><p>If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an <strong>activation lock check</strong> when buying second-hand phones.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices"></a>Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices</h2><p>If you’re planning to sell your Apple iPhone 15 or are curious about the status of a lost phone, you should also perform an <strong>iCloud lock check</strong>. This feature, crucial for security, can prevent a new user from accessing the phone without your permission. Here’s how you can check the status:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone"><a href="#Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Check Within the Phone"></a>Method 1: Check Within the Phone</h3><p>The first way to check your devices’ iCloud activation lock status is through the Apple iPhone 15 devices themselves. There are two ways to do this, as presented in this section.</p><h4 id="Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App"><a href="#Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App"></a>Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App</h4><p>First, open Settings on your iDevice. At the top of its menu, tap on your profile name.</p><p>If you see an iCloud account listed here and you’re signed in, your device is still linked to that iCloud account. Thus, it will still be under the iCloud Activation Lock. If there is no iCloud activation lock, it should look like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone no icloud lock"                ></p><h4 id="Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation"><a href="#Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation"></a>Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation</h4><p>If you are setting up the phone afresh or after a factory reset, proceed with the initial setup steps. Suppose the Apple iPhone 15 device asks for an Apple ID and password previously associated with the Apple iPhone 15 device at any point during the setup. In that case, it indicates that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active. This occurs if the Apple iPhone 15 device was not correctly erased before the reset.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number"><a href="#Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using IMEI Number"></a>Method 2: Using IMEI Number</h3><p>Every iPhone or iPad has its own IMEI number. It can be used to check details about the Apple iPhone 15 device remotely, including <strong>checking the iCloud Activation Lock</strong>. Here are the steps to use your IMEI number to <strong>check the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong> of your phone using third-party apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your <strong>Settings</strong> app on the iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>General</strong>, then choose <strong>About.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find the <strong>IMEI</strong> number by scrolling down. It’s a 15-digit number that’s unique to your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-04.jpg"                      alt="imei page iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Several third-party websites offer services to check iCloud Activation Lock status using the IMEI number. Some of these services are free, while others might charge a small fee. Make sure to use a reputable service to avoid scams.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> On the chosen service’s website, enter your device’s IMEI number.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The service will provide details regarding the iCloud activation lock status.</li></ul><p>Remember, if selling, always erase your device and sign out of iCloud to remove the activation lock. For buyers, always ensure your device is free from previous iCloud accounts.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1770776">                    <video width="240" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1770776">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1770776.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Ftokenmetrics.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1770776%2F20702'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1770776/20702"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Part 3: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock</h2><p>If you discover that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active on your iOS device, removing it is crucial, especially if you plan to sell or repurpose it.

The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 15 device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.</p><p>The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 15 device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 15 device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.</p><p>A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13&#x2F;.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.</p><p>If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-and-iPad"><a href="#How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad"></a>How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad</h2><p>There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.</p><p>With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple"><a href="#Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple"></a>Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple</h2><p>In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device happens to be the real owner, then he&#x2F;she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.</p><p>This approach, however, has a downside. It’s only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.</p><h2 id="Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock"><a href="#Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock"></a>Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock</h2><p>One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of the iCloud Activation Lock Removal process, you can easily bypass the iCloud Activation Lock and remove it completely from your device. The following is a detailed process on how you can seamlessly do it with the peace of mind that your data and all valuable information will be kept in place.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Purchase-the-Service"><a href="#Step-1-Purchase-the-Service" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Purchase the Service"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase the Service</h4><p>For you to unlock the iCloud lock, using this method, you first have to obtain the rights to do so. Securing these rights is simply done by purchasing their services. The price at which you’ll be charged will depend on the model of your device. To buy these services, visit <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >the webiste <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of Official iPhoneUnlock and select “iCloud Unlock” to its “iCloud Unlock&#x2F;Activation Lock Removal” feature, then enter your IMEI number from the drop-down list as illustrated below. Once you have located your phone make or model, click on the “Add to Cart” tab. The price at which you are going to be charged will be displayed on your right-hand side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719794951413.jpg"                      alt="fix icloud lock"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Enter-your-Email-Address"><a href="#Step-2-Enter-your-Email-Address" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Enter your Email Address"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your Email Address</h4><p>A new page with your purchase details as shown below will open up.

Choose your best-preferred method by clicking on the “Pay with Credit or Debit Card” tab and enter your bank details. Once you submit your payment, your iCloud lock will be unlocked after a period of between 2-3 days. A confirmation email will be sent to your designated email address. Just like that, your iCloud lock fix is removed, and you are free to use iCloud.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719797331077.jpg"                      alt="fix icloud activation lock"                ></p><h2 id="Method-4-How-to-Fix-iCloud-with-Efficient-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-How-to-Fix-iCloud-with-Efficient-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: How to Fix iCloud with Efficient Tool"></a>Method 4: How to Fix iCloud with Efficient Tool</h2><p>If you aren’t able to fix iCloud lock with the provided methods above, we would like to recommend you Dr.Fone – <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – one of its kind tools that work when you wish to unlock screen locks effortlessly.

There are two ways to do this, as presented in this section.</p><h4 id="Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App"><a href="#Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App"></a>Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App</h4><p>First, open Settings on your iDevice. At the top of its menu, tap on your profile name.</p><p>If you see an iCloud account listed here and you’re signed in, your device is still linked to that iCloud account. Thus, it will still be under the iCloud Activation Lock. If there is no iCloud activation lock, it should look like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone no icloud lock"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151872/7443" target="_top" id="2151872">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151872" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151872/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h4 id="Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation"><a href="#Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation"></a>Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation</h4><p>If you are setting up the phone afresh or after a factory reset, proceed with the initial setup steps. Suppose the Apple iPhone 15 device asks for an Apple ID and password previously associated with the Apple iPhone 15 device at any point during the setup. In that case, it indicates that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active. This occurs if the Apple iPhone 15 device was not correctly erased before the reset.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number"><a href="#Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using IMEI Number"></a>Method 2: Using IMEI Number</h3><p>Every iPhone or iPad has its own IMEI number.

It prevents your phone from getting used by the wrong hands. Consequently, it secures your data from getting exploited in case of theft.</p><p>However, it can be troublesome if you don’t take enough care. Your phone can get stuck on the activation lock screen if you don’t remember the password or have bought a second-hand device.</p><p>If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is iCloud locked, there are ways to get it unlocked. We’ll initially suggest reaching the seller. We will clear up the <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro iCloud bypass</strong> methods if you can’t. So sit back and relax. This detailed guide explains how to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettius.sjv.io/c/5597632/2139118/17108" target="_top" id="2139118">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17108-2139118" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="468" height="60"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettius.sjv.io/i/5597632/2139118/17108"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner"><a href="#1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner" class="headerlink" title="1.

Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>Asking the owner about their Apple ID credentials is the first approach in this guide. You can disable the activation lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro when you get those. However, this technique isn’t ensured to help you, as all of you realize that iCloud has individual data about the client.</p><p>Subsequently, no owner will want to give them to another person. In this way, you will be left without a response.

For instance, if you have a Mac with the operating system before macOS Catalina, access the “Summary” tab by clicking the Apple iPhone 15 device icon within iTunes. While holding the “Shift” key on Windows or the “Option” key on Mac, click “Restore iPhone.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-16.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone via itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will be asked to select the IPSW file.

This feature plays a crucial role in safeguarding Apple devices against unauthorized access. It’s a way to ensure that only the rightful owner can use and access the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Originally designed as a theft deterrent, the iCloud Activation Lock on used Apple Devices becomes especially important when buying or selling second-hand phones.</p><p>Understanding the status of this lock is essential to ensure a secure and legitimate transaction. In this 2024 guide, you’ll dive into how to <strong>check the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong>. It’s a critical step for anyone involved in the trade of used Apple devices online or otherwise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone activation lock page"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Check-Activation-Lock-Status-Before-You-Buy-a-Used-Device"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Check-Activation-Lock-Status-Before-You-Buy-a-Used-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device"></a>Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device</h2><p>Understanding the iCloud Activation Lock is essential when purchasing a used Apple device. This security feature, designed by Apple, is activated when ‘Find My iPhone’ is enabled. It links the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to the owner’s Apple ID, preventing others from activating it without the owner’s permission. This lock is crucial for preventing unauthorized use of lost or stolen devices.</p><p>Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, <strong>checking the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong> is important. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Power on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device has been properly erased.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone lockscreen"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> <strong>If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device still needs to be fully erased. In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start setting up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> During the setup, if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.</li></ul><p>If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an <strong>activation lock check</strong> when buying second-hand phones.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices"></a>Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices</h2><p>If you’re planning to sell your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or are curious about the status of a lost phone, you should also perform an <strong>iCloud lock check</strong>. This feature, crucial for security, can prevent a new user from accessing the phone without your permission. Here’s how you can check the status:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone"><a href="#Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Check Within the Phone"></a>Method 1: Check Within the Phone</h3><p>The first way to check your devices’ iCloud activation lock status is through the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max devices themselves. There are two ways to do this, as presented in this section.</p><h4 id="Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App"><a href="#Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App"></a>Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App</h4><p>First, open Settings on your iDevice. At the top of its menu, tap on your profile name.</p><p>If you see an iCloud account listed here and you’re signed in, your device is still linked to that iCloud account. Thus, it will still be under the iCloud Activation Lock. If there is no iCloud activation lock, it should look like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone no icloud lock"                ></p><h4 id="Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation"><a href="#Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation"></a>Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation</h4><p>If you are setting up the phone afresh or after a factory reset, proceed with the initial setup steps. Suppose the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device asks for an Apple ID and password previously associated with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device at any point during the setup. In that case, it indicates that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active. This occurs if the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device was not correctly erased before the reset.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082520/7443" target="_top" id="2082520">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082520" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082520/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number"><a href="#Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using IMEI Number"></a>Method 2: Using IMEI Number</h3><p>Every iPhone or iPad has its own IMEI number.

However, the optimum time falls between 1-3 business days.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997690/19272" target="_top" id="1997690">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997690" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997690/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="How-to-bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#How-to-bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="How to bypass iCloud Activation Lock"></a>How to bypass iCloud Activation Lock</h3><h4 id="Step-1-Visit-Official-iPhone-Unlock-Website"><a href="#Step-1-Visit-Official-iPhone-Unlock-Website" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Visit Official iPhone Unlock Website"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Visit Official iPhone Unlock Website</h4><p>Visit <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and select “iCloud Unlock”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/icloud-unlock.jpg"                      alt="unlock iCloud locked iPhone no download"                ></p><p>Enter your handset type and IMEI number in the spaces provided and click on the “Add to Cart” icon.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14731098024925.jpg"                      alt="unlock iCloud lock no download"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Add-Contact-Details"><a href="#Step-2-Add-Contact-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Add Contact Details"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add Contact Details</h4><p>Once you have clicked on the “Add to Cart” icon, a new page with an email option under the “Contact Details” will open up.

Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 14 and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html" >bypass the iCloud activation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lock.</p><h3 id="What-Does-This-Mean-for-You"><a href="#What-Does-This-Mean-for-You" class="headerlink" title="What Does This Mean for You?"></a>What Does This Mean for You?</h3><p>If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 14 device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 14 device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone 14 is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.</p><p>Now that you know everything you need to know about an iCloud-locked iPhone, read on to find out how to unlock an iCloud-locked iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPhone-iPad-iPod-Safely-and-Efficiently-iOS-12-0-16-6-Supported"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPhone-iPad-iPod-Safely-and-Efficiently-iOS-12-0-16-6-Supported" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Unlock iCloud Locked iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;iPod Safely and Efficiently?

This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.</p><p>While this is a welcomed addition for those looking to protect their device, it can also be a major inconvenience for those who have lost or forgotten their iCloud password. Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information. You will learn in this post how to use Checkra1n iCloud bypass to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad.</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Checkra1n?"></a>Part 1: What is Checkra1n?</h2><p>Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.</p><p>Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don’t know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.</p><p>Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>The tool doesn’t require tech skills</li><li>It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices</li><li>Supports a wide range of hardware platforms</li><li>It is not possible to exploit remotely</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Jailbreaking older devices is limited</li><li>A reboot won’t save them</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?</h2><p>You may consider using Checkra1n if you are looking for a method to bypass the iCloud activation lock.

Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 15 device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 15 device stays connected with the past owner’s iCloud account.</p><p>It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials. However, we’ve discovered a few potential ways to <strong>bypass iPad 2&#x2F;3 and Apple iPhone 15</strong>. Also, we will introduce you to the best and expert bypass tool available in the market. Therefore, we strongly suggest you stay with us and download Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock. It is safe during the process. So, how about we begin?</p><p>Explore four practical methods to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock on your iPad 2&#x2F;3 and Apple iPhone 15. These solutions help you regain access to your device and its features, enabling you to enjoy your iPad without any restrictions.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner"><a href="#Method-1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner"></a>Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To <strong>bypass iPad 3</strong> activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 15 device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.</p><p>However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 15 device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your iPad, go to the “Settings” application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.</p><ul><li>If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to “iCloud” and sign out.</li><li>If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click “Sign Out.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="sign out"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will request the password to your Apple account. Enter it and turn the iPad off.

This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don’t have the credentials using third-party software.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vsQWFTA1UY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1868590/19272" target="_top" id="1868590">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1868590" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1868590/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool"></a>Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool</h2><p>Sometimes, getting some penny spent is a great idea.

Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code.

This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don’t have the credentials using third-party software.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vsQWFTA1UY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool"></a>Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool</h2><p>Sometimes, getting some penny spent is a great idea.

One way to unlock iCloud locked phone is to bypass the iCloud activation lock by following the steps below</p><p>Step 1. Take your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and while on the “Activate iPhone” screen, press the home button and then press the “Wi-Fi” settings. Next to the “Wi-Fi” symbol, tap on “i”. Now you need to change the existing DNS settings. The DNS settings you need to type are as follows:</p><ol><li>If you are in the USA type in 104.154.51.7</li><li>In Europe, type 104.155.28.90</li><li>In Asia, type 104.155.220.58</li><li>The rest of the world, please type in 78.109.17.60</li></ol><p>Step 2. Tap on the “Back” button then click “Done”. Next, click “Activation help”. Once you have done that, you will see a message that says: You have successfully connected to my server.” If you tap on the menu, you will be able to access different iCloud services such as iCloud Locked User Chat, Mail, Social, Maps, Video, YouTube, Audia, and games, among others.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-unlock-iCloud-lock-by-Apple-iPhone-Unlock"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-unlock-iCloud-lock-by-Apple-iPhone-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to unlock iCloud lock by Apple iPhone Unlock"></a>Part 4: How to unlock iCloud lock by Apple iPhone Unlock</h2><p>Sometimes it may not be possible to completely unlock your iCloud Lock. For instance, the free method of unlocking your iCloud Lock only works on iOS 9 and iOS 8 for iPhones. Anything else will not work properly. Moreover, you may not be able to know how to unlock iCloud lock-free if you are in certain countries. That is when you can think of using the Official iPhone Unlock service which will completely unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro without any hassle. The iCloud Activation Lock Removal tool will quickly remove the iCloud activation lock from the previous owner’s account. In short, this is an easy and seamless tool for removing the iCloud lock to set your own.</p><p>Step 1 - Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Apple iPhone unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by clicking on this link.</p><p>Step 2 - Enter the IMEI&#x2F;Serial number of your device and send it.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14720745007162.jpg" alt="Enter your IMEI/Serial number"></p><p>Step 3 - Just wait for a confirmation message telling you that the iCloud Lock has been removed.</p><p>Step 4 - Now create a new iCloud account and start using your device</p><p>This tool works on all iPhone 6, 6+, 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4, and iPad 4, 3, 2 Air 2 and also works on iOS, and it doesn’t matter why you are unlocking it from.</p><h3 id="Wrap-it-up"><a href="#Wrap-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it up"></a>Wrap it up</h3><p>Unlike the free iCloud Lock unlock solution, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iCloud Activation Lock Removal) tool provides a permanent solution to the problem of how to unlock iCloud locked irrespective of your country.

Apple has placed the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.</p><p>Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer"><a href="#Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Activation Lock Primer"></a>Part 1: Activation Lock Primer</h2><p>Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.</p><p>Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max)"></a>Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max)</h2><p>An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone but forgot to erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device before submitting and consequently, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to make it useable again. There are a few ways you can go about it.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-Using-Apple-ID"><a href="#Method-1-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-Using-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.
