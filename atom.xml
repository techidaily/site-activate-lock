This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don’t have the credentials using third-party software.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vsQWFTA1UY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool"></a>Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool</h2><p>Sometimes, getting some penny spent is a great idea.

Before we take a look at how to bypass an activation lock on an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad, let’s examine what an activation lock on an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad entails.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/bypass-activation-lock.jpg"                      alt="bypass activation lock"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-or-iPad"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-or-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

Without access to the owner’s Apple ID and&#x2F;or password, accessing the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device becomes impossible. Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.</p><p>This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-or-iPad-with-Previous-Owner’s-Account"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-or-iPad-with-Previous-Owner’s-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad with Previous Owner’s Account?</h2><p>Using a valid Apple ID and password is the easiest way to bypass the activation lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini. In any case, if you legitimately purchased the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device from the previous owner, they should have no qualms giving you these details. If it’s a new device, and you are the original owner, you will have this information ready to use for activation. Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/add-apple-id-password.jpg"                      alt="add apple id password"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Have the previous owner enter their details on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini, or request them to send the same to you.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Fire up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and when prompted on the Activation Lock Screen, enter the Apple ID and password.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Within a few minutes, the home screen should appear on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Upon reaching this page, navigate to the settings tab to sign out of iCloud.</li></ul><p><em><strong>A note for users before we proceed with the bypass steps:</strong><br>Users on iOS 12 or earlier can locate this option on settings, navigating to iCloud, then signing out.

Open up settings, click reset and proceed to erase all content, including settings.</li><li><strong>Step 7.</strong> At this point, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad will restart&#x2F;reboot, allowing you to set up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device anew.</li></ul><p>There are a few web-based resources and tricks that facilitate this procedure. Suffice to say, these methods, known as Jailbreaking, do not work when activation lock is enabled. Stick to using credible methods like the one listed above. Alternatively, you can use iCloud to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini activation lock. It does, however, require the original owner’s iCloud information.

Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.</p><p>With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple"><a href="#Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple"></a>Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple</h2><p>In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device happens to be the real owner, then he&#x2F;she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.</p><p>This approach, however, has a downside. It’s only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://laganoo.pxf.io/c/5597632/1521325/16446" target="_top" id="1521325">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1521325" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://laganoo.pxf.io/i/5597632/1521325/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock"><a href="#Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock"></a>Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock</h2><p>One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

It prevents your phone from getting used by the wrong hands. Consequently, it secures your data from getting exploited in case of theft.</p><p>However, it can be troublesome if you don’t take enough care. Your phone can get stuck on the activation lock screen if you don’t remember the password or have bought a second-hand device.</p><p>If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is iCloud locked, there are ways to get it unlocked. We’ll initially suggest reaching the seller. We will clear up the <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong> methods if you can’t. So sit back and relax. This detailed guide explains how to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><h3 id="1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner"><a href="#1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner" class="headerlink" title="1.

Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>Asking the owner about their Apple ID credentials is the first approach in this guide. You can disable the activation lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max when you get those. However, this technique isn’t ensured to help you, as all of you realize that iCloud has individual data about the client.</p><p>Subsequently, no owner will want to give them to another person. In this way, you will be left without a response. It is a bad situation, so we could never propose you focus on this method for <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong>.</p><p>This method is best if the owner lives nearby, and you can meet face to face. In particular, they must know their Apple ID password. When you get together, request them to enter their Apple ID credentials, since they might be reluctant to share them via a call. It is very straightforward to remove their Apple ID and the activation lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-5-5s-5c-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="erase all content"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> When the activation lock screen appears, enter the Apple ID credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> After removing the activation lock, unpair any accessories connected to it.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Sign out of the App Store, iCloud, and iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> At last, erase all content and settings by exploring the General menu from the Settings app. Click the Reset button for the “Erase All Content and Settings” option.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2.

Apple has placed the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.</p><p>Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer"><a href="#Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Activation Lock Primer"></a>Part 1: Activation Lock Primer</h2><p>Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.</p><p>Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max)"></a>Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max)</h2><p>An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone but forgot to erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device before submitting and consequently, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to make it useable again.

The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.</p><p>The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.</p><p>A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13&#x2F;.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.</p><p>If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?"></a>Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is lost or stolen, one of the first steps you should take is to erase the data remotely.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?</h2><p>Many third-party services claim to offer solutions to bypass iCloud activation using the IMEI number. These services propose to unlock iCloud activation by altering or manipulating the IMEI number. They promise a free and swift solution to bypass iCloud activation. Follow these steps to bypass iCloud activation using IMEI:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin with finding your device’s IMEI number. You can do it by using the *#06# code. Otherwise, you can get it from the phone box or in iPhone “Settings.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-5.jpg"                      alt="search for imei"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now access a reliable iCloud Activation lock bypassing via IMEI number service.

It’s important to note that the legitimacy and reliability of such services can vary. Keep in mind that using unofficial unlocking services may come with risks, and it’s essential to research and choose a reputable provider if you decide to pursue this option. Additionally, be cautious about potential scams and ensure that you fully understand the terms and conditions of any service you use.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?"></a>Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?</h2><p>Are you looking for a way to bypass the iCloud Activation lock without an IMEI code? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides a solution for unlocking iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch without a passcode.

Click “Got It” to agree to the warning and proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-6.png"                      alt="check if gsm or cdma"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Jailbreak Your Device and Complete the Process</strong></p><p>Following this, follow the on-screen instructions to jailbreak your iDevice.

Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.</p><p>With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple"><a href="#Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple"></a>Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple</h2><p>In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device happens to be the real owner, then he&#x2F;she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.</p><p>This approach, however, has a downside. It’s only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.</p><h2 id="Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock"><a href="#Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock"></a>Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock</h2><p>One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple"><a href="#Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple"></a>Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple</h2><p>In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device happens to be the real owner, then he&#x2F;she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.</p><p>This approach, however, has a downside. It’s only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.</p><h2 id="Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock"><a href="#Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock"></a>Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock</h2><p>One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-and-iPad"><a href="#How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-SE-2022-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) and iPad"></a>How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone SE (2022) and iPad</h2><p>There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.</p><p>With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple"><a href="#Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple"></a>Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple</h2><p>In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device happens to be the real owner, then he&#x2F;she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.</p><p>This approach, however, has a downside. It’s only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.</p><h2 id="Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock"><a href="#Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock"></a>Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock</h2><p>One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of the iCloud Activation Lock Removal process, you can easily bypass the iCloud Activation Lock and remove it completely from your device. The following is a detailed process on how you can seamlessly do it with the peace of mind that your data and all valuable information will be kept in place.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Purchase-the-Service"><a href="#Step-1-Purchase-the-Service" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Purchase the Service"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase the Service</h4><p>For you to unlock the iCloud lock, using this method, you first have to obtain the rights to do so. Securing these rights is simply done by purchasing their services. The price at which you’ll be charged will depend on the model of your device. To buy these services, visit <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >the webiste <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of Official iPhoneUnlock and select “iCloud Unlock” to its “iCloud Unlock&#x2F;Activation Lock Removal” feature, then enter your IMEI number from the drop-down list as illustrated below. Once you have located your phone make or model, click on the “Add to Cart” tab. The price at which you are going to be charged will be displayed on your right-hand side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719794951413.jpg"                      alt="fix icloud lock"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Enter-your-Email-Address"><a href="#Step-2-Enter-your-Email-Address" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Enter your Email Address"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your Email Address</h4><p>A new page with your purchase details as shown below will open up.

Just like that, your iCloud lock fix is removed, and you are free to use iCloud.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719797331077.jpg"                      alt="fix icloud activation lock"                ></p><h2 id="Method-4-How-to-Fix-iCloud-with-Efficient-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-How-to-Fix-iCloud-with-Efficient-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: How to Fix iCloud with Efficient Tool"></a>Method 4: How to Fix iCloud with Efficient Tool</h2><p>If you aren’t able to fix iCloud lock with the provided methods above, we would like to recommend you Dr.Fone – <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – one of its kind tools that work when you wish to unlock screen locks effortlessly.

If your Apple iPhone SE (2022) is locked, your primary concern should be how to <strong>bypass the activation lock on an iPhone</strong>, like the Apple iPhone SE (2022) SE. It would help if you were careful about the techniques you use to <strong>unlock iCloud-locked iPhone</strong>. There are a lot of companies and software out there that promise results but don’t deliver.</p><p>In this article, we’ll discuss the different safe <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-to-remove-icloud-account.html" >iCloud removal <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or iPhone SE iCloud bypass methods. So read on if you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, iPad, or iPod with you!</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQckthGQm-8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-information-about-iCloud-lock"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-information-about-iCloud-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic information about iCloud lock"></a>Part 1: Basic information about iCloud lock</h2><h3 id="What-Does-iCloud-Lock-Mean"><a href="#What-Does-iCloud-Lock-Mean" class="headerlink" title="What Does iCloud Lock Mean?"></a>What Does iCloud Lock Mean?</h3><p>Part of the normal process of setting up a new iPhone is to register the phone with an Apple ID. Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone SE (2022) and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html" >bypass the iCloud activation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lock.</p><h3 id="What-Does-This-Mean-for-You"><a href="#What-Does-This-Mean-for-You" class="headerlink" title="What Does This Mean for You?"></a>What Does This Mean for You?</h3><p>If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it.

This promises to be one of the most expansive and unique games in a long line of genre-defining titles with an enormous open world map and a wealth of engaging stories and activities to participate in. Valhalla builds on many of the mechanics players first saw in Assassins’s Creed: Origins and Odyssey, containing more RPG elements, a variety of combat styles, and plenty of upgrades.</p><p> I played the game on PC for several days, but it’s also available on all other major platforms including the upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/price-release-date-specs-xbox-series-x-5077092" >Xbox Series X <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , Xbox One, upcoming<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/playstation-5-4778089" >PlayStation 5 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , and PlayStation 4.</p><h2 id="Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled"><a href="#Story-A-lot-going-on-and-none-of-it-to-be-spoiled" class="headerlink" title="Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled"></a><strong>Story: A lot going on, and none of it to be spoiled</strong></h2><p> There’s a lot to say here, but not much that can be said without spoilers. Given how engaging I found the plot, it would be a shame to spoil it in any way. Suffice it to say that, though it begins as a typical revenge story, it soon becomes more complex and interesting. You play as Eivor, a male or female warrior who raids England during the reign of Alfred the Great.</p><p> Aside from the basis in history, there are fascinating mythological elements to the storyline, and obviously, much attention was paid to crafting an authentic recreation of the cultures being represented here. The game does a good job of focusing on telling a story about Vikings, while also working the series namesake “Assassins” into the mix in a plausible manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/pWujlWPf0ylYYpeoTEbp7X8U0yM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-4-07677871281c40a384f2df55f83e86a4.jpg"                      alt="AC Vallhalla 2"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Perhaps more interesting than the main plot are the side quests sprinkled liberally about the world. These are typically informal, chance encounters and, though they do grant experience towards skill points, their primary point is to tell an intriguing story, which they accomplish with aplomb. The characters are almost invariably well-acted, and while short, these quests are remarkably well written and worth seeking out.</p><p> The prologue map alone in Norway covers 15 square kilometers, and has between 10 and 15 hours worth of gameplay. It honestly is worth the cost of admission in its own right. I could easily have spent 20 hours there just climbing mountains. However, the core of the game is set in England, and the map is absolutely gigantic.</p><p> In total, the game’s various open world areas cover a staggering 140 square kilometers, nearly ten times the size of the prologue area. By this rough estimate, there should be at least 120 hours worth of content in this game, including a roughly 60-hour main campaign. Missions, mysteries, and treasure in abundance ensure that the wilderness never grows stale.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/Vk4XvoE4lJwcjde1C_tJUVBc0Ac=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-9-a5e8ef2a5bef455d8cbaa9e749167f53.jpg"                      alt="AC sneak"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993647">                    <video width="128" height="480" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993647">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993647.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:80px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993647%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993647/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master"><a href="#Gameplay-Easy-to-pick-up-challenging-to-master" class="headerlink" title="Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master"></a><strong>Gameplay: Easy to pick up, challenging to master</strong></h2><p> Valhalla’s gameplay will be familiar to fans of the Assassin’s Creed franchise, particularly the more recent entries in the series. As usual, there are tweaks and innovations, but it was easy enough for me to pick up, with my most recent experience being with AC Unity. Players who’ve played Origins and Odyssey will find much to be familiar. The fluid movement and iconic parkour makes navigating around the expansive open world fun and engaging, though novices may accidentally fling themselves off a cliff or two by accident as they learn the ropes.</p><p> Fall damage is back, but don’t worry though, most falls won’t kill you, and you can just scarf a few berries and be right as rain. It’s worth the risk, as climbing mountains is in itself an activity that offers hours of freeform fun. As is traditional for Assassin’s Creed games, you can safely leap from any high place so long as there is a pile of hay, leaves, or a shallow pond to break your fall.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells.</p><p> There are traditional observation points to unlock, but there are also plenty of interesting peaks, spires, and mountain tops with unique views to discover. Most aren’t marked, so there’s a sense of discovery in seeking them out, and thanks to a robust photo mode, it’s fun to document your hiking and climbing adventures.</p><p> Traveling long distances around the map can be done via unlockable fast travel locations, but the vast, beautiful world crafted for Valhalla encouraged me to explore it on foot, even for paths I had trodden more than once. This is aided by your ability to summon a horse or a longboat to your position, either of which is an exciting way to travel.</p><p> Ubisoft has truly mastered the mechanics of boats, and sailing is just pure joy with your loyal crew singing their way down the fjords as the wind whistles in the rigging, your ship riding the realistic swells. Alternatively, your bard may accompany your seafaring with diverting tales. If there’s one downside is that unlike Odyssey, there’s no ship-to-ship naval combat, but perhaps that makes sense because the Vikings were more land raiders despite their extensive use of longboats to travel.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/giaP-JV9QK6uFcdU_di4iWkvszw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-5-56a01de51a2a4540ae8650bece502873.jpg"                      alt="AC Valhalla 3"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137222/26400" target="_top" id="2137222">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137222" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137222/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> Combat is fast, brutal, and varied with deep customization and different potential approaches. There are many ways to approach each situation, and none of them are wrong. You can sneak in and pick the enemy off one by one, dumping their carcasses in bushes so as not to tip off their friends, or you can nail them from a distance with arrows. Alternatively, you can stride in, axes twirling, and cut a bloody swath through your foes.</p><p> Skill points are given to you as you level up and can be used to upgrade your character and hone their skill in ranged, stealth, or melee fields. Abilities can also be discovered by reading books hidden throughout the world. This is the main way you can specialize your character build. If you want a more traditional assassin experience, put all your points into stealth or ranged, but if you want to live your life as a brutal Viking warlord, go all-in on melee. My favorite move is one in which you hurl throwing axes all around you in slow motion.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side.</p><p> A particularly thrilling experience in Valhalla is summoning your berserker crew to come and fight at your side. Even better are raids, where you leap from your ship among a horde of screaming Vikings to slay your enemies and loot their towns.</p><p> Raiding becomes a vital component of the game, as raids are the only way to build your settlement. It’s not a particularly complex base building mechanic, as it only involves raiding the requisite supplies and returning them to your settlement, whereupon a new building magically appears. It’s fun to watch your settlement grow, and you gradually unlock a variety of different functions and quests.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/n9S5L4JClTiqP1vYa_7cTGw6o0c=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-7-d89d4a9941b8488ea6ef1aeba6486895.jpg"                      alt="AC ship"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135352/19272" target="_top" id="2135352">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135352" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135352/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize"><a href="#Difficulty-and-Content-Settings-Lots-to-customize" class="headerlink" title="Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize"></a><strong>Difficulty and Content Settings: Lots to customize</strong></h2><p> Valhalla gives you plenty of ways to customize your experience.

I particularly enjoyed Flyting, which is a battle of words These are timed, competitive poetry contests where you must quickly select the most appropriate verse from a list of options. It’s both amusing and character building.</p><p> Orlog is an interesting dice game that I would honestly like to own in real life, and the drinking minigame is a highly enjoyable reflex-based challenge. A nice touch is that the results of imbibing huge amounts of mead persist for a period of time after the minigame is complete. After all, are you really a Viking warrior if you’re not completely drunk all the time?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/trRirIDsjFej03o-_HDCFsnnrzs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-6-5449cde060b441a499a5189fda9a7a0a.jpg"                      alt="AC tattoos"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Customization-Lots-of-stuff-to-tweak"><a href="#Customization-Lots-of-stuff-to-tweak" class="headerlink" title="Customization: Lots of stuff to tweak"></a><strong>Customization: Lots of stuff to tweak</strong></h2><p> As in Odyssey, the game allows you to play as either male or female, and offers a range of cosmetic options, mainly by way of tattoos and hairstyles. New tattoo patterns are acquired through parkour challenges. What’s more interesting is the gameplay affecting clothing and weapons that alter your appearance—I particularly appreciated that upgrading those items affects their looks. You can choose from different ravens and horses, and change the appearance of your longship. Eventually, you will also be able to customize the appearance of your settlement.</p><p> I was particularly struck by the amber rays of the setting sun that slanted through the rigging of my longboat as I returned from a mountain climbing excursion.</p><h2 id="Graphics-Epic-good-looks"><a href="#Graphics-Epic-good-looks" class="headerlink" title="Graphics: Epic good looks"></a><strong>Graphics: Epic good looks</strong></h2><p> Valhalla is an absolutely gorgeous game.

I was particularly struck by the amber rays of the setting sun that slanted through the rigging of my longboat as I returned from a mountain climbing excursion.</p><p> Towns and cities are richly detailed, with people going about their daily business in this muddy and gritty medieval setting. The wilderness is also magnificent, with wild natural beauty and towering ruins in equal measure. Wildlife and farm animals are both present in this world, adding vibrancy to the countryside.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/YazM4IIiw6qfR_cd-AfR8Cek9pg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-10-b813058de14c4b92978d22f84715ab98.jpg"                      alt="AC Mountain"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-and-Performance-A-rough-start"><a href="#Setup-Process-and-Performance-A-rough-start" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process and Performance: A rough start"></a><strong>Setup Process and Performance: A rough start</strong></h2><p> Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla is typical of modern AAA titles in that it requires a big download and a considerable amount of storage space to house on your PC or console. With the day one update to consider, you’re looking at around 50GB.</p><p> Now, keep in mind that these are my pre-launch experiences with the game not fully patched. I initially installed it on my<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/asus-zephyrus-g14-review-a-no-compromises-gaming-laptop-5084841" >Asus Zephyrus G14 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> gaming laptop, which I reviewed recently and found to be capable of running modern titles at high or max settings. However, Valhalla appears to be a whole different kind of beast and played havoc on my machine.</p><p> When I first jumped into the game after the intro cutscene, I was greeted with the most horrendous graphics glitching I’ve ever experienced. Thinking this was because I had foolishly maxed the settings I restarted after tweaking down graphics, but upon restart, the glitches were appearing in the menu itself. I exited the game and the glitches persisted for about 10 seconds after Valhalla had closed. The built-in benchmarking tool in the game refused to run entirely. In the end, I decided not to push my luck with the laptop.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/R1pb8_CqlpJqAmK9Ka9-pgyOyJk=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-3-ea07cee8afaa4cc89c4e2bb286b894a0.jpg"                      alt="AC ruins"                ></p><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><p> On a<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-pcs-4045451" >gaming PC <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with a more powerful processor, more RAM, and an RTX 2070<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-graphics-cards-4692676" >GPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , I didn’t encounter any glitches. However, the game is extremely power-hungry, and I was only able to run it at max settings with 60fps at 1080p. Ubisoft titles are known for being poorly optimized at launch, so this game should perform better after a few patches. Still, it’s clearly designed for next-gen consoles and the latest PC hardware. If you are playing on PC, be sure to utilize the benchmarking tool to find the ideal settings for your system.</p><p> Of course, if you’re playing on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-consoles-4154610" >console <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> you don’t have to worry about performance issues since the game is better optimized. It’s currently available for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and will be available for the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 at launch. You can also get it on<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/google-stadia-review-4788032" >Google Stadia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="Price-Typical-AAA"><a href="#Price-Typical-AAA" class="headerlink" title="Price: Typical AAA"></a><strong>Price: Typical AAA</strong></h2><p> The base game will set you back the typical $60, while the gold edition bundles in the season pass and costs a full $100. That will include the planned expansions which will add Ireland and France to the map. Expensive though $100 is, it does promise a potentially huge amount of content. The game also has microtransactions, which is a bit of a bummer, though these weren’t integrated into the game at the time of writing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/teY5MG-6xAT5sxNurIFy_iYPPvs=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Assassins-Creed-Valhalla-2-58ab82ef1f624e01b1c1c6dab8bca06b.jpg"                      alt="AC horse"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2112007/7443" target="_top" id="2112007">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2112007" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2112007/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Andy Zahn</p><h2 id="Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion"><a href="#Assassin’s-Creed-Valhalla-vs-Watch-Dogs-Legion" class="headerlink" title="Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion"></a><strong>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla vs. Watch Dogs: Legion</strong></h2><p> It’s interesting that Ubisoft decided to launch two third-person action games set in England within a span of a few weeks. Where Valhalla is set in the Middle Ages,<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/watch-dogs-legion-review-a-new-setting-for-the-series-5085469" >Watch Dogs: Legion <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is set in a near-future sci-fi dystopia, though in both games you are battling against tyrannical rulers in England. Choose Watch Dogs if you want sci-fi focused on hackers and non-violent solutions, and Valhalla if you love bloody medieval fighting and exploration.</p><p> It’s also worth mentioning the resemblance between Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla to The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim. The comparison is inescapable due to the fact that both are based on Norse culture. While Valhalla is certainly a more historically grounded game as opposed to Skyrim’s totally fictional fantasy realm, Valhalla will nonetheless be familiar and exciting for fans of Skyrim.</p><p> Final Verdict: Epic stories and exciting combat in a sprawling open world.</p><p> Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla exceeds, as Assassin’s Creed games so often do, in creating the most painstakingly detailed virtual recreation of a place and period possible. It’s got exploration, intense combat, and enthralling stories by the bucket full, and it’s easy to get lost in its sheer scope and scale. Just beware if you’re playing on a PC that will test the limits of your gaming rig.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  Assassin’s Creed Valhalla (PC)</li><li>Price  $60.00</li><li>Release Date  November 2020</li><li>Platforms  PC, Xbox Series X, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Stadia</li><li>Rating  M</li></ul><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-extensive-analysis-best-cloud-storage-recommendations/"><u>[New] Extensive Analysis Best Cloud Storage Recommendations</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-elite-mac-graphic-preserver/"><u>2024 Approved Elite Mac Graphic Preserver</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-streamlining-meetings-with-snap-camera-on-teams/"><u>2024 Approved Streamlining Meetings with Snap Camera on Teams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/a-how-to-guide-on-bypassing-the-apple-iphone-14-pro-max-icloud-lock-by-drfone-ios/"><u>A How-To Guide on Bypassing the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max iCloud Lock</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/download-techkey-bluetooth-drivers-compatible-with-windows-1078/"><u>Download Techkey Bluetooth Drivers Compatible with Windows 10/7/8</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/fixing-xcom-2-game-crashes-on-pc-solutions-and-tips-for-windows/"><u>Fixing XCOM 2 Game Crashes on PC – Solutions and Tips for Windows</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/guide-to-install-and-operate-handbrake-video-converter-for-windows-1011-users/"><u>Guide to Install and Operate HandBrake Video Converter for Windows 10/11 Users</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-fix-iphone-se-2022-could-not-be-activatedreached-issue-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Fix iPhone SE (2022) Could Not Be Activated/Reached Issue</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/how-to-use-chatgpt-for-minimizing-virtual-disruptions-a-guide-with-8-key-examples/"><u>How to Use ChatGPT for Minimizing Virtual Disruptions: A Guide with 8 Key Examples</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-fixes-how-to-recover-forgotten-icloud-password-on-your-apple-iphone-13-pro-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, Easy Fixes How To Recover Forgotten iCloud Password On your Apple iPhone 13 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-remove-find-my-iphone-without-apple-id-on-your-apple-iphone-xs-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Remove Find My iPhone without Apple ID On your Apple iPhone XS?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-show-wi-fi-password-on-lava-blaze-curve-5g-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, How to Show Wi-Fi Password on Lava Blaze Curve 5G</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-10-best-tools-to-bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-apple-iphone-xs-you-should-try-out-by-drfone-ios/"><u>In 2024, The 10 Best Tools to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock On Apple iPhone XS You Should Try Out</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-reviews.techidaily.com/save-big-on-your-dream-rig-the-stylish-fractal-design-north-case-at-just-119/"><u>Save Big on Your Dream Rig: The Stylish Fractal Design North Case at Just $119!</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/top-7-icloud-activation-bypass-tools-for-your-apple-iphone-6s-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Top 7 iCloud Activation Bypass Tools For your Apple iPhone 6s</u></a></li><li><a href="https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/top-7-icloud-activation-bypass-tools-for-your-apple-iphone-6s-plus-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Top 7 iCloud Activation Bypass Tools For your Apple iPhone 6s Plus</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-jailbreak-iCloud-locked-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max"><a href="#How-to-jailbreak-iCloud-locked-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max" class="headerlink" title="How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max"></a>How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max</h2><p>Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock"><a href="#Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?"></a>Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?</h2><p>Many people have always asked me if it’s possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner"><a href="#Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner"></a>Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner</h2><p>This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.</p><p>Sign in to the iCloud account&gt; Go to “Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max”&gt; Select each and every device under this tab&gt; click “Erase iPhone.” Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we’ll proceed to the next step, which is to click the “Next” tab. Once we’ve done this, a new tab with “Remove Account” will emerge.

With that said, if you just purchased a used iOS device, you may be required to bypass the activation lock on your device using iCloud, or the previous user’s account. Before we take a look at how to bypass an activation lock on an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad, let’s examine what an activation lock on an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad entails.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/bypass-activation-lock.jpg"                      alt="bypass activation lock"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-or-iPad"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-or-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad?</h2><p>This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery. Without access to the owner’s Apple ID and&#x2F;or password, accessing the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device becomes impossible. Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.</p><p>This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-or-iPad-with-Previous-Owner’s-Account"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Pro-Max-or-iPad-with-Previous-Owner’s-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad with Previous Owner’s Account?</h2><p>Using a valid Apple ID and password is the easiest way to bypass the activation lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini. In any case, if you legitimately purchased the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device from the previous owner, they should have no qualms giving you these details. If it’s a new device, and you are the original owner, you will have this information ready to use for activation. Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/add-apple-id-password.jpg"                      alt="add apple id password"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Have the previous owner enter their details on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini, or request them to send the same to you.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Fire up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and when prompted on the Activation Lock Screen, enter the Apple ID and password.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Within a few minutes, the home screen should appear on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Upon reaching this page, navigate to the settings tab to sign out of iCloud.</li></ul><p><em><strong>A note for users before we proceed with the bypass steps:</strong><br>Users on iOS 12 or earlier can locate this option on settings, navigating to iCloud, then signing out. For iOS 13 or later, click on settings, then your name, and sign out.</em></p><ul><li><strong>Step 5.</strong> Chances are, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad will prompt you to enter the original user’s ID and Password. Simply enter the details available to you.</li><li><strong>Step 6.</strong> Finally, the best part of the unlocking process; navigate to the settings tab to erase all data. Open up settings, click reset and proceed to erase all content, including settings.</li><li><strong>Step 7.</strong> At this point, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad will restart&#x2F;reboot, allowing you to set up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device anew.</li></ul><p>There are a few web-based resources and tricks that facilitate this procedure.

Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner"></a>1. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner</h3><p>For an <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong>, you’ll require a couple of significant pieces of data:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode in mind.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="owners apple id"                ></p><p>After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, if you see the lock screen passcode, you can type the passcode and set up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device without the Apple ID.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device completely set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.</p><h3 id="2-Use-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2. Use DNS Bypass"></a>2. Use DNS Bypass</h3><p><strong>What is DNS?</strong></p><p>Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.</p><p>You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can’t utilize the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong> via DNS bypass.</p><p><strong>Steps to Follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button&gt; More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:</p></li><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You will see the next page choice; don’t click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Look down the page, go to the menu and set up your applications, music, camera, and so forth.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Emergency-Call"><a href="#3-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="3. Emergency Call"></a>3. Emergency Call</h3><p>Utilizing the Emergency call strategy is another free <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong> method. It is among the clearest and speediest procedures to remove your iCloud account. The guidelines underneath will show you how to unlock your iCloud free by utilizing the Emergency Call technique:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Select your preferred language and current region.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, on the iCloud activation screen, press the home button three times to begin on Voice Command and multiple times to close down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Again push on a home button, and this time select Emergency Calls.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, you need to key in *#96274825*0000*1#. Then press the call button multiple times.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Then, you need to modify the last digit from 1 to 2 and repeatedly press the call button.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Perform this strategy once more. When you adhere to every one of the guidelines, press the back button, and turn around to the starting screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now, just like you did before, select your language and country. After picking it, you will see the bypass screen.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock"></a>4.

Similar to iOS devices, it makes it tough for others to access your device without permission. Once activated, it requires your Apple ID and password for various functions. These include the likes of disabling Find My Mac, erasing the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device, or using it after a factory reset.</p><p>This feature works hand-in-hand with the ‘Find My’ app. It ensures your data’s safety even if your MacBook is lost or stolen.

Fortunately, Apple provides a streamlined process to reset and retrieve forgotten passwords. This allows users to regain entry to their devices. Apple offers a mechanism to reset forgotten passwords via the Apple ID account recovery process.</p><p>Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://appleid.apple.com/sign-in" >Apple ID account page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> through a web browser on any device.

Follow these steps to bypass the <strong>Mac Activation Lock</strong>:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Utilize a different Apple device, like an iPhone, iPad, or another Mac, that is currently signed in with the identical Apple ID.

As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.</p><p>Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don’t know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.</p><p>Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>The tool doesn’t require tech skills</li><li>It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices</li><li>Supports a wide range of hardware platforms</li><li>It is not possible to exploit remotely</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Jailbreaking older devices is limited</li><li>A reboot won’t save them</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?</h2><p>You may consider using Checkra1n if you are looking for a method to bypass the iCloud activation lock.
