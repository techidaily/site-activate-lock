You can use these details to open the account and use it for the <strong>Apple iPhone 6s bypass</strong>.</p><p>However, it is the least suggested and least effective method. It is because asking someone about their account details is unethical. The iCloud account has a lot of personal information about the user. Therefore, no one will be willing to hand you the account credentials unless they are your close relatives.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Ask-the-previous-owner-to-bypass-it-iCloud-remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Ask-the-previous-owner-to-bypass-it-iCloud-remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2.

Click “Remove from Account” to disassociate it from iCloud.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3.

It controls the DNS server and redirects the authentication way of your phone. It assists you with the Apple iPhone 6s iCloud bypass using these steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-se-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to the Wi-Fi settings and click Configure IP. Then choose Manual and click “Add Server.”</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click on the “i” and enter the DNS server IP according to your area, which is:</p><ul><li>USA: 104.154.51.7</li><li>South America: 35.199.88.219</li><li>Europe: 104.155.28.90</li><li>Asia: 104.155.220.58</li><li>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</li><li>The rest: 78.100.17.60</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Go back and turn on Wi-Fi.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Tap on Next Page and go back to bypass the lock.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Set up the gadget according to your liking.</p><p>The downside of this strategy is that it is short-term.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="New-Multiple-Ways-How-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock-On-your-Apple-iPhone-6s"><a href="#New-Multiple-Ways-How-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock-On-your-Apple-iPhone-6s" class="headerlink" title="New Multiple Ways: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock On your Apple iPhone 6s"></a>New Multiple Ways: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock On your Apple iPhone 6s</h2><p>Undeniably, one of Apple’s selling points is its focus on security. iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple stuff all enjoy this robust security system. Of course, this is mainly made by Apple through iCloud or Apple ID. This system is designed to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access. This is what makes Apple’s devices highly secure and sought after.</p><p>However, a common challenge arises when you acquire a second-hand iPhone or iPad. You may find it’s connected to the previous owner’s iCloud account through an Activation Lock. This situation can be a significant hurdle, rendering the Apple iPhone 6s device almost unusable. As you may expect, this article will help you <strong>remove the iCloud Activation Lock</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg"                      alt="activation lock page ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 6s device to a specific Apple ID.</p><h3 id="Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock</h3><p>Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.</p><p>In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password"><a href="#Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password"></a>Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password</h2><p>If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 6s device, learning <strong>how to remove iCloud Activation Lock</strong> is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.</p><p>If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 6s device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 6s device. If the Apple iPhone 6s device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to <strong>Settings &gt;</strong> Tap on the profile on top of the app &gt; <strong>Sign Out</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-02.jpg"                      alt="icloud sign out button"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten your Apple ID, it can be recovered by signing in with your Apple ID account. Then, click the <strong>Forgot Password</strong> button. You may need to answer security questions or receive a code on a trusted device to complete this process.</p><h3 id="Removing-Activation-Lock-via-iCloud-For-Offline-Devices"><a href="#Removing-Activation-Lock-via-iCloud-For-Offline-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)"></a>Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)</h3><p>Alternatively, you can remove the iCloud account by following the steps below. You can ask the original owner to do this or do it independently if you can access the account.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to &lt;<a class="link"   href="http://www.icloud.com/find%3E" >www.iCloud.com/find&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any web browser.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 6s device owner’s ID) and password.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-03.jpg"                      alt="login with apple id"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the list of devices associated with this Apple ID, select the one you wish to unlock.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click <strong>Remove from Account</strong>. This action will disassociate the Apple iPhone 6s device from the Apple ID, removing the Activation Lock.</li></ul><p>Following these steps, you can <strong>remove the iCloud Activation Lock</strong> from your device, provided you can access the necessary Apple ID credentials. This method is the most secure and straightforward way to regain access to your device without compromising your data or the Apple iPhone 6s device’s functionality.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-2-Remove-iCloud-Without-an-Apple-ID-Code-in-a-Few-Clicks"><a href="#Part-3-Method-2-Remove-iCloud-Without-an-Apple-ID-Code-in-a-Few-Clicks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Method 2: Remove iCloud Without an Apple ID Code in a Few Clicks"></a>Part 3. Method 2: Remove iCloud Without an Apple ID Code in a Few Clicks</h2><p>Third-party tools like <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/"><u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u></a> provide an effective solution when you can’t access the Apple ID passcode. Dr.Fone is recognized as an all-in-one mobile solution, catering to various needs beyond unlocking devices. It has features like recovery, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-13-black-screen.html"><u>system repair</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer/android-to-android-data-transfer-app.html"><u>data transfer</u></a>, <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/restore-from-icloud-backup.html"><u>backup and restore</u></a>, and Screen Unlock (iOS).</p><p>The Screen Unlock feature is valuable for bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock without needing the original Apple ID passcode.

Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 6s device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 6s device stays connected with the past owner’s iCloud account.</p><p>It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials. However, we’ve discovered a few potential ways to <strong>bypass iPad 2&#x2F;3 and Apple iPhone 6s</strong>. Also, we will introduce you to the best and expert bypass tool available in the market. Therefore, we strongly suggest you stay with us and download Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock. It is safe during the process. So, how about we begin?</p><p>Explore four practical methods to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock on your iPad 2&#x2F;3 and Apple iPhone 6s.

Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner"></a>Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To <strong>bypass iPad 3</strong> activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 6s device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.</p><p>However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 6s device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your iPad, go to the “Settings” application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.</p><ul><li>If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to “iCloud” and sign out.</li><li>If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click “Sign Out.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="sign out"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will request the password to your Apple account.

But it might be a problem if they have sold you a stolen phone and don’t have the remotest clue about the Apple ID.</p><p>You don’t need to worry about the iPad activation lock if it’s a genuine phone. The past user can remotely wipe out the iPad Apple account without having the phone in their control by following these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Explore the appleid.apple.com site from a web browser and sign in with your Apple ID details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="find iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Apple iPhone 6s devices tab to see every one of the connected iDevices.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Pick your iPad model from the list of devices.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Then, at that point, click the “Remove from Account” button to get it unlocked.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 6s device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 6s, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 6s device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 6s device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?</h2><p>Many third-party services claim to offer solutions to bypass iCloud activation using the IMEI number. These services propose to unlock iCloud activation by altering or manipulating the IMEI number. They promise a free and swift solution to bypass iCloud activation. Follow these steps to bypass iCloud activation using IMEI:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin with finding your device’s IMEI number. You can do it by using the *#06# code. Otherwise, you can get it from the phone box or in iPhone “Settings.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-5.jpg"                      alt="search for imei"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now access a reliable iCloud Activation lock bypassing via IMEI number service.

It’s important to note that the legitimacy and reliability of such services can vary. Keep in mind that using unofficial unlocking services may come with risks, and it’s essential to research and choose a reputable provider if you decide to pursue this option. Additionally, be cautious about potential scams and ensure that you fully understand the terms and conditions of any service you use.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?"></a>Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?</h2><p>Are you looking for a way to bypass the iCloud Activation lock without an IMEI code? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides a solution for unlocking iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch without a passcode.

Tap “Unlock Now,” and if you are unlocking a CDMA device, you will be presented with a warning prompt. Click “Got It” to agree to the warning and proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-6.png"                      alt="check if gsm or cdma"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Jailbreak Your Device and Complete the Process</strong></p><p>Following this, follow the on-screen instructions to jailbreak your iDevice.

It prevents your phone from getting used by the wrong hands. Consequently, it secures your data from getting exploited in case of theft.</p><p>However, it can be troublesome if you don’t take enough care. Your phone can get stuck on the activation lock screen if you don’t remember the password or have bought a second-hand device.</p><p>If your Apple iPhone 6s is iCloud locked, there are ways to get it unlocked. We’ll initially suggest reaching the seller. We will clear up the <strong>Apple iPhone 6s iCloud bypass</strong> methods if you can’t. So sit back and relax. This detailed guide explains how to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 6s iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-6s-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-6s-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 6s iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 6s iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><h3 id="1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner"><a href="#1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner" class="headerlink" title="1.

Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>Asking the owner about their Apple ID credentials is the first approach in this guide. You can disable the activation lock on your Apple iPhone 6s when you get those. However, this technique isn’t ensured to help you, as all of you realize that iCloud has individual data about the client.</p><p>Subsequently, no owner will want to give them to another person. In this way, you will be left without a response. It is a bad situation, so we could never propose you focus on this method for <strong>Apple iPhone 6s iCloud bypass</strong>.</p><p>This method is best if the owner lives nearby, and you can meet face to face. In particular, they must know their Apple ID password. When you get together, request them to enter their Apple ID credentials, since they might be reluctant to share them via a call. It is very straightforward to remove their Apple ID and the activation lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-5-5s-5c-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="erase all content"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> When the activation lock screen appears, enter the Apple ID credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> After removing the activation lock, unpair any accessories connected to it.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Sign out of the App Store, iCloud, and iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> At last, erase all content and settings by exploring the General menu from the Settings app. Click the Reset button for the “Erase All Content and Settings” option.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 6s device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 6s, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 6s device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 6s device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code.

Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 6s device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your iPad, go to the “Settings” application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.</p><ul><li>If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to “iCloud” and sign out.</li><li>If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click “Sign Out.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="sign out"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will request the password to your Apple account.

You can use these details to open the account and use it for the <strong>Apple iPhone 6s bypass</strong>.</p><p>However, it is the least suggested and least effective method. It is because asking someone about their account details is unethical. The iCloud account has a lot of personal information about the user. Therefore, no one will be willing to hand you the account credentials unless they are your close relatives.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Ask-the-previous-owner-to-bypass-it-iCloud-remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Ask-the-previous-owner-to-bypass-it-iCloud-remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2.

It controls the DNS server and redirects the authentication way of your phone. It assists you with the Apple iPhone 6s iCloud bypass using these steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-se-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to the Wi-Fi settings and click Configure IP. Then choose Manual and click “Add Server.”</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click on the “i” and enter the DNS server IP according to your area, which is:</p><ul><li>USA: 104.154.51.7</li><li>South America: 35.199.88.219</li><li>Europe: 104.155.28.90</li><li>Asia: 104.155.220.58</li><li>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</li><li>The rest: 78.100.17.60</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Go back and turn on Wi-Fi.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Tap on Next Page and go back to bypass the lock.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Set up the gadget according to your liking.</p><p>The downside of this strategy is that it is short-term.

Well, if you just bought your phone from eBay, a second-hand vendor, or a friend, the chances are that its iCloud account is locked; that is, the new user will not able able to use it unless you know the username and password of the previous owner. Luckily, there is a way to unlock the iCloud account lock on your Apple iPhone 6s if you cannot reach or convince the previous owner to reset the iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 6s.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQckthGQm-8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 6s has an iCloud account lock on it?"></a>Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 6s has an iCloud account lock on it?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 6s has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.</p><p>At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html" >iCloud Activation Lock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device’s files, features, and functions.</p><p>This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html" >a second-hand iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 6s device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.</p><p>It doesn’t matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 6s. Whether you <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html" >jailbreak <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html" >reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 6s.</p><p>If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 6s or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Further Reading:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html" >How to sign out of Apple ID without a password? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool"></a>Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool</h2><p>iCloud Bypass Tool is an iCloud unlock tool that can help you bypass the iCloud Lock or even remove the problematic iCloud account altogether.

Apple has placed the Apple iPhone 6s as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.</p><p>Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 6s. We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer"><a href="#Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Activation Lock Primer"></a>Part 1: Activation Lock Primer</h2><p>Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone 6s gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.</p><p>Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-6s"><a href="#Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-6s" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 6s)"></a>Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 6s)</h2><p>An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone but forgot to erase the Apple iPhone 6s device before submitting and consequently, the Apple iPhone 6s device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that Apple iPhone 6s to make it useable again. There are a few ways you can go about it.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-Using-Apple-ID"><a href="#Method-1-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-Using-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.

Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune"></a>Method 3. Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune</h3><p>If you are an IT administrator and are using Microsoft services, you may have given employees iPhones. When employees leave or are made to leave, it is possible that the Apple iPhone 6s devices they leave behind are still signed in with a password only they know. There is a way Apple provides for Microsoft Intune to disable Activation Lock for corporate devices.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/what-is-intune.png"                      alt="what is microsoft intune"                ></p><ul><li>Step 1: Sign in to the admin center on Microsoft Endpoint Manager.</li><li>Step 2: Select Devices under Intune.</li><li>Step 3: Select All Devices.</li><li>Step 4: Locate the Apple iPhone 6s device you want to disable the lock for, and under the Hardware section, copy the Activation Lock Bypass Code given under Conditional Access.</li><li>Step 5: Under the Overview pane of the Apple iPhone 6s device, select Wipe.</li><li>Step 6: When the Apple iPhone 6s device resets, it prompts for the Apple ID and password.

This option is restrictive in nature as you will be unable to use the Apple iPhone 6s to make calls or access cellular services including iCloud. This option is best for when you want to see&#x2F; recover some data from the Apple iPhone 6s device that you would otherwise lose.</p><h2 id="Conclusion-1"><a href="#Conclusion-1" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Removing the Activation Lock is supposed to be as difficult as possible for the wrong people and as easy as possible for the right ones. This means that if you have the Apple ID credentials that were used to enable Activation Lock, you can simply use them to remove Activation Lock and unlock the Apple iPhone 6s just as easily. However, things get increasingly difficult from that point on if you do not have Apple ID credentials. You can use iCloud to erase the Apple iPhone 6s device and remove the Apple iPhone 6s device from the Apple ID account it is connected to, remotely. If you are an IT administrator deploying Microsoft services, you can use Microsoft Intune to get around the Activation Lock easily.</p><p>If you are an iPhone 5 to iPhone X user, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is available as an option to bypass Activation Lock on the iPhone. It should be noted that this process will cause the Apple iPhone 6s device to be “rooted”, meaning that data services and iCloud will not function and phone calls cannot be made from the Apple iPhone 6s device.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins><br><ins

Henceforth whenever your phone is turned off or performs any type of action such as erasing the Apple iPhone 6s device or reactivating the Apple iPhone 6s device, then your device will ask for unlocking iCloud activation.</p><h3 id="How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-was-iCloud-activation-locked"><a href="#How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-6s-was-iCloud-activation-locked" class="headerlink" title="How do I know My Apple iPhone 6s was iCloud activation locked?"></a>How do I know My Apple iPhone 6s was iCloud activation locked?</h3><p>If you are purchasing an iPhone or any other Apple device from someone, you need to make sure that the Apple device is no longer linked to the prior owner’s account. To make sure you are on the safe side, you could check it for yourself. There are two ways to check:</p><p>1. You can visit <a class="link"   href="https://icloud.com/activationlock" >https://icloud.com/activationlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from any Computer or MAC to check the present Activation Lock status of the Apple iPhone 6s device.</p><p>2. Follow the steps below to be sure that you can use your Apple iPhone 6s device hassle-free:</p><ol><li>Switch on the Apple iPhone 6s device and slide to unlock it.</li></ol><p>If the screen displays a passcode lock screen or you can see the Home Screen, the Apple iPhone 6s device you have purchased has not been erased. The seller will go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Reset &gt; Erase All Content and Settings. Ensure the seller clears the phone before he hands it over to you for use.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719307921421.jpg"                      alt="erase all content and settings"                ></p><ol start="2"><li>Set up your device.</li></ol><p>Once you have selected the language, country, and connected to a network, the Apple iPhone 6s device will start activation.

The security feature was known as <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html" >iCloud Activation Lock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device’s files, features, and functions.</p><p>This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html" >a second-hand iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on.

Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.</p><p>It doesn’t matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 6s. Whether you <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html" >jailbreak <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html" >reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 6s.</p><p>If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 6s or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Further Reading:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html" >How to sign out of Apple ID without a password? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool"></a>Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool</h2><p>iCloud Bypass Tool is an iCloud unlock tool that can help you bypass the iCloud Lock or even remove the problematic iCloud account altogether.

Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner"><a href="#Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner"></a>Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner</h2><p>This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 6s from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.</p><p>Sign in to the iCloud account&gt; Go to “Find My Apple iPhone 6s”&gt; Select each and every device under this tab&gt; click “Erase iPhone.” Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we’ll proceed to the next step, which is to click the “Next” tab. Once we’ve done this, a new tab with “Remove Account” will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.</p><h3 id="Visit-an-Authorised-Apple-Store"><a href="#Visit-an-Authorised-Apple-Store" class="headerlink" title="Visit an Authorised Apple Store"></a>Visit an Authorised Apple Store</h3><p>You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it’s still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Jailbreak-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Jailbreak-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone</h2><p>You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6s device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6s and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6s.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-the-Software"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Download the Software"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Software</h4><p>Visit the following website <a class="link"   href="http://en.pangu.io/" >http://en.pangu.io/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and click on the “Download and Help” tab. A new page with the download option will open up. The entire download is about 21MB in size. With the file downloaded, install the program on your Mac and launch it. Its interface looks like the screenshot below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736110927930.jpg"                      alt="how to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Connect-iDevice"><a href="#Step-2-Connect-iDevice" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Connect iDevice"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Connect iDevice</h4><p>Switch OFF the “Find My Apple iPhone 6s” feature and switch ON the “Aeroplane Mode.” Connect your Apple iPhone 6s to your Mac using its USB cable and click on the “Start Jailbreak” tab to initiate the jailbreaking process.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Confirmation"><a href="#Step-3-Confirmation" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Confirmation"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirmation</h4><p>A new interface with a screen notification will open up. Carefully read the three steps before proceeding. If you are okay with the information, click on the “Already did” icon. The jailbreaking process will begin from this point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736112213161.jpg"                      alt="start to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Jailbreak-Complete"><a href="#Step-4-Jailbreak-Complete" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Jailbreak Complete"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Jailbreak Complete</h4><p>Your iPhone will reboot a number of times, which is normal. Once the process is done, you will get a “Jailbreak Succeeded” message and the Cydia icon display on your iDevice. Unplug your Apple iPhone 6s and turn ON the “Find My Apple iPhone 6s” feature. Set up your Apple iPhone 6s using your new preferred details.</p><h2 id="Part-4-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-offline-with-few-clicks"><a href="#Part-4-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-offline-with-few-clicks" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock offline with few clicks"></a>Part 4: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock offline with few clicks</h2><p>To bypass <strong><em>jailbreak locked iPhone</em></strong> offline, you can rely on Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS).

Launch the program and click on the “Unlock” option on the main interface. Don’t forget to connect your Apple iPhone 6s to the computer via the original lightning cord.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/drfone-home-interface.jpg"                      alt="drfone home interface"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Choose the Option</strong></p><p>On the next screen, you need to press the “Unlock Apple ID” option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png"                      alt="new interface"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Just Key in Password</strong></p><p>Now, you have to type in the screen password so that the scanning process becomes easier.

You are allowed to check if you have unlocked the iCloud ID successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/remove-apple-id-8.png"                      alt="complete"                ></p><p>From the methods mentioned above, we can comfortably conclude that it’s easy to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. Regardless of the method you choose, jailbreaking a locked phone is as easy as formatting one, as long as the restrictive iCloud lock has been removed by a previous method, such as the one mentioned

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-6s-and-iPad"><a href="#How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-6s-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 6s and iPad"></a>How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 6s and iPad</h2><p>There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.</p><p>With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple"><a href="#Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple"></a>Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple</h2><p>In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 6s device happens to be the real owner, then he&#x2F;she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.</p><p>This approach, however, has a downside. It’s only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.</p><h2 id="Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock"><a href="#Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock"></a>Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock</h2><p>One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of the iCloud Activation Lock Removal process, you can easily bypass the iCloud Activation Lock and remove it completely from your device. The following is a detailed process on how you can seamlessly do it with the peace of mind that your data and all valuable information will be kept in place.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Purchase-the-Service"><a href="#Step-1-Purchase-the-Service" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Purchase the Service"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase the Service</h4><p>For you to unlock the iCloud lock, using this method, you first have to obtain the rights to do so. Securing these rights is simply done by purchasing their services. The price at which you’ll be charged will depend on the model of your device. To buy these services, visit <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >the webiste <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of Official iPhoneUnlock and select “iCloud Unlock” to its “iCloud Unlock&#x2F;Activation Lock Removal” feature, then enter your IMEI number from the drop-down list as illustrated below. Once you have located your phone make or model, click on the “Add to Cart” tab. The price at which you are going to be charged will be displayed on your right-hand side.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719794951413.jpg"                      alt="fix icloud lock"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Enter-your-Email-Address"><a href="#Step-2-Enter-your-Email-Address" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Enter your Email Address"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Enter your Email Address</h4><p>A new page with your purchase details as shown below will open up.

Once you submit your payment, your iCloud lock will be unlocked after a period of between 2-3 days. A confirmation email will be sent to your designated email address. Just like that, your iCloud lock fix is removed, and you are free to use iCloud.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719797331077.jpg"                      alt="fix icloud activation lock"                ></p><h2 id="Method-4-How-to-Fix-iCloud-with-Efficient-Tool"><a href="#Method-4-How-to-Fix-iCloud-with-Efficient-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: How to Fix iCloud with Efficient Tool"></a>Method 4: How to Fix iCloud with Efficient Tool</h2><p>If you aren’t able to fix iCloud lock with the provided methods above, we would like to recommend you Dr.Fone – <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – one of its kind tools that work when you wish to unlock screen locks effortlessly.

The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 6s device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.</p><p>The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 6s device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 6s device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.</p><p>A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13&#x2F;.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.</p><p>If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?"></a>Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 6s is lost or stolen, one of the first steps you should take is to erase the data remotely.

Make sure that the only person that can access it is the owner of the mobile. However, there will be challenges if you have bought a used iPhone and if the owner has not logged out of his account on that phone. If you are in this situation, then you will need to either contact the previous owner or be locked out of your phone. The first one is a tedious option, and the latter would be the least one that we would want to happen.</p><p>There are, however, various ways how you can bypass the iCloud Activation Lock without having to contact its previous owner. We will share with you the different ways that you can do it on your own and remove the automated lock and continue using your phone leisurely.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Causes-iCloud-Activation-lock"><a href="#Part-1-What-Causes-iCloud-Activation-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Causes iCloud Activation lock?"></a>Part 1: What Causes iCloud Activation lock?</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a great feature that Apple has added to the “Find My iPhone” application which helps prevent other people aside from yourself from accessing your phone and files. Activating your iCloud Activation lock can be done in just a few steps, and this could even be done remotely if your phone is not within your reach. This is a great feature if you are a victim of theft and would like to remotely lock your phone to be sure that it cannot be accessed by the thief or anyone else.</p><p>You can follow the steps below to remotely lock your device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the “Find My iPhone” on your browser while locking your phone remotely.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Log in with your credentials. Make sure it is the same credentials you use for iCloud.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Under the Apple iPhone 6s devices’ list, you can look and tap for the text that says “Lost Mode”.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> From there, you can tap on actions, then choose to either tap on “Lost Mode” or “Erase Phone”.</li></ul><p>Learn about all the solutions to unlock iPhone quickly through the video below:</p><iframe allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wp8NTysB4e0"></iframe><p><em>If you forget the Activation Lock on your iDevice and fail to access it, you must bypass iCloud Activation Lock.

Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 6s device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab.

In such cases, the optimal resolution involves reinstalling the iOS version through iTunes. Follow the steps below to personally choose the IPSW file and employ iTunes for the installation on your iOS device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access the ipsw.me website using a web browser and download the compatible IPSW file for your iOS device.

While holding the “Shift” key on Windows or the “Option” key on Mac, click “Restore iPhone.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-16.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone via itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will be asked to select the IPSW file.

When jailbreaking a device, Checkra1n allows you to select the “Untested versions” option. While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 6s device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:</p><p><strong>Instructions.</strong> To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the “Options” and select the “Untested Versions” and “Safe Mode” options.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="New-Guide-How-To-Check-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-On-Your-Apple-iPhone-6s"><a href="#New-Guide-How-To-Check-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-On-Your-Apple-iPhone-6s" class="headerlink" title="New Guide: How To Check iCloud Activation Lock Status On Your Apple iPhone 6s"></a>New Guide: How To Check iCloud Activation Lock Status On Your Apple iPhone 6s</h2><p>Apple’s iOS is renowned for its robust security features, including the iCloud Activation Lock. This feature plays a crucial role in safeguarding Apple devices against unauthorized access. It’s a way to ensure that only the rightful owner can use and access the Apple iPhone 6s device. Originally designed as a theft deterrent, the iCloud Activation Lock on used Apple Devices becomes especially important when buying or selling second-hand phones.</p><p>Understanding the status of this lock is essential to ensure a secure and legitimate transaction. In this 2024 guide, you’ll dive into how to <strong>check the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong>. It’s a critical step for anyone involved in the trade of used Apple devices online or otherwise.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-01.jpg"                      alt="iphone activation lock page"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-To-Check-Activation-Lock-Status-Before-You-Buy-a-Used-Device"><a href="#Part-1-How-To-Check-Activation-Lock-Status-Before-You-Buy-a-Used-Device" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device"></a>Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device</h2><p>Understanding the iCloud Activation Lock is essential when purchasing a used Apple device. This security feature, designed by Apple, is activated when ‘Find My iPhone’ is enabled. It links the Apple iPhone 6s device to the owner’s Apple ID, preventing others from activating it without the owner’s permission. This lock is crucial for preventing unauthorized use of lost or stolen devices.</p><p>Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, <strong>checking the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong> is important. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Power on the Apple iPhone 6s device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone 6s device has been properly erased.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone lockscreen"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> <strong>If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone 6s device still needs to be fully erased. In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone 6s device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start setting up the Apple iPhone 6s device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone 6s device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> During the setup, if the Apple iPhone 6s device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone 6s device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone 6s device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.</li></ul><p>If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an <strong>activation lock check</strong> when buying second-hand phones.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices"></a>Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices</h2><p>If you’re planning to sell your Apple iPhone 6s or are curious about the status of a lost phone, you should also perform an <strong>iCloud lock check</strong>. This feature, crucial for security, can prevent a new user from accessing the phone without your permission. Here’s how you can check the status:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone"><a href="#Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Check Within the Phone"></a>Method 1: Check Within the Phone</h3><p>The first way to check your devices’ iCloud activation lock status is through the Apple iPhone 6s devices themselves. There are two ways to do this, as presented in this section.</p><h4 id="Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App"><a href="#Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App"></a>Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App</h4><p>First, open Settings on your iDevice. At the top of its menu, tap on your profile name.</p><p>If you see an iCloud account listed here and you’re signed in, your device is still linked to that iCloud account. Thus, it will still be under the iCloud Activation Lock. If there is no iCloud activation lock, it should look like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone no icloud lock"                ></p><h4 id="Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation"><a href="#Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation"></a>Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation</h4><p>If you are setting up the phone afresh or after a factory reset, proceed with the initial setup steps. Suppose the Apple iPhone 6s device asks for an Apple ID and password previously associated with the Apple iPhone 6s device at any point during the setup. In that case, it indicates that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active. This occurs if the Apple iPhone 6s device was not correctly erased before the reset.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number"><a href="#Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using IMEI Number"></a>Method 2: Using IMEI Number</h3><p>Every iPhone or iPad has its own IMEI number. It can be used to check details about the Apple iPhone 6s device remotely, including <strong>checking the iCloud Activation Lock</strong>. Here are the steps to use your IMEI number to <strong>check the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong> of your phone using third-party apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your <strong>Settings</strong> app on the iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>General</strong>, then choose <strong>About.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find the <strong>IMEI</strong> number by scrolling down. It’s a 15-digit number that’s unique to your device.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-04.jpg"                      alt="imei page iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Several third-party websites offer services to check iCloud Activation Lock status using the IMEI number. Some of these services are free, while others might charge a small fee. Make sure to use a reputable service to avoid scams.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> On the chosen service’s website, enter your device’s IMEI number.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The service will provide details regarding the iCloud activation lock status.</li></ul><p>Remember, if selling, always erase your device and sign out of iCloud to remove the activation lock. For buyers, always ensure your device is free from previous iCloud accounts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Part 3: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock</h2><p>If you discover that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active on your iOS device, removing it is crucial, especially if you plan to sell or repurpose it. There are a few methods to do this, depending on whether you have physical access to the phone.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Removing-Apple-ID-Through-Apple’s-Means"><a href="#Method-1-Removing-Apple-ID-Through-Apple’s-Means" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Removing Apple ID Through Apple’s Means"></a>Method 1: Removing Apple ID Through Apple’s Means</h3><p>The simplest way to remove the iCloud activation lock is by <a href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html"><u>removing the Apple ID from the phone</u></a>.

Apple has placed the Apple iPhone 6s as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.</p><p>Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 6s. We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer"><a href="#Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Activation Lock Primer"></a>Part 1: Activation Lock Primer</h2><p>Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone 6s gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.</p><p>Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-6s"><a href="#Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-6s" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 6s)"></a>Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 6s)</h2><p>An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone but forgot to erase the Apple iPhone 6s device before submitting and consequently, the Apple iPhone 6s device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that Apple iPhone 6s to make it useable again.

Download New Checkra1n Version</h3><p>Crucial for a successful jailbreak is carefully selecting the <a href="https://checkra.in/"><u>appropriate Checkra1n version</u></a>. Compatibility varies across devices, making it essential to choose the version that suits your device. Error 31 issues are likely linked to the specific Checkra1n version in use. In such instances, the recommended solution is to experiment with alternative versions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-14.jpg"                      alt="checkra1n latest version"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Install-iOS-Firmware-From-iTunes-and-Retry-Jailbreaking"><a href="#Fix-4-Install-iOS-Firmware-From-iTunes-and-Retry-Jailbreaking" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4.

Install iOS Firmware From iTunes and Retry Jailbreaking</h3><p>When encountering <strong>Checkra1n jailbreak</strong>, error 31 may be attributed to the iOS version on your device. In such cases, the optimal resolution involves reinstalling the iOS version through iTunes. Follow the steps below to personally choose the IPSW file and employ iTunes for the installation on your iOS device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access the ipsw.me website using a web browser and download the compatible IPSW file for your iOS device. Before installing, ensure that the “Find My” service is disabled.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-15.jpg"                      alt="disable find my on iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Connect the iOS device to the computer and wait for iTunes&#x2F;Finder to detect it once all requirements are satisfied. For instance, if you have a Mac with the operating system before macOS Catalina, access the “Summary” tab by clicking the Apple iPhone 6s device icon within iTunes. While holding the “Shift” key on Windows or the “Option” key on Mac, click “Restore iPhone.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-16.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone via itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will be asked to select the IPSW file. Choose the file you downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. Once complete, re-try the jailbreaking and see if error 31 is resolved.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-17.jpg"                      alt="access file to complete installation process"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Consider-Using-Other-Options-in-Checkra1n"><a href="#Fix-5-Consider-Using-Other-Options-in-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5. Consider Using Other Options in Checkra1n"></a>Fix 5. Consider Using Other Options in Checkra1n</h3><p>If the reason behind <strong>Checkra1n error 31</strong> is the Apple iPhone 6s device incompatibility, Checkra1n provides an inbuilt way. When jailbreaking a device, Checkra1n allows you to select the “Untested versions” option. While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 6s device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:</p><p><strong>Instructions.</strong> To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the “Options” and select the “Untested Versions” and “Safe Mode” options. Then, try jailbreaking your device and see if error 31 is resolved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-18.jpg"                      alt="enable safe mode and untested versions"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-6-Try-a-Special-Method-While-Using-Checkra1n"><a href="#Fix-6-Try-a-Special-Method-While-Using-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6.

Try a Special Method While Using Checkra1n</h3><p>At times, the solutions you are looking for can be found among the experiences of fellow users. We found a Reddit post in our search to find solutions to <strong>Checkra1n Error 31</strong>. In this post, a Reddit user explained a hack he had found to solve error 31 when jailbreaking using Checkra1n.</p><p>Remember that this hack includes a specific Checkra1n version and experience that specific user. While you can emulate the experience, the results aren’t guaranteed. Here is what that user tried for successful jailbreaking using Checkra1n:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Checkra1n version 0.10.2 beta on your computer. Now, connect your Apple iPhone 6s to DFU Mode to the system. Initiate the jailbreaking process until the “Right before Trigger” option appears.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-19.jpg"                      alt="reach right before trigger screen"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> The user suggests you unplug the cable and re-plug it after waiting for 5 to 7 seconds. According to the user, this action should do the trick. To get out of DFU Mode, press and hold both buttons (Home + Lock) for 10 seconds and go on to release the home button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-20.jpg"                      alt="exit dfu mode iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Jailbreak-iOS-Using-Mac-A-Simple-Guide-To-Refer-To"><a href="#Bonus-Jailbreak-iOS-Using-Mac-A-Simple-Guide-To-Refer-To" class="headerlink" title="Bonus.
