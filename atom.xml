You can access information, make payments, join Wi-Fi networks, and more with a simple scan.</p><p> However, your QR code scanner may sometimes fail to recognize or read the codes correctly. This can be frustrating, especially when you urgently need to access the content within the code. Before you give up, here are some fixes you can try to get your QR code scanner to work again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068425/7443" target="_top" id="2068425"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068425"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068425/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="1-Check-if-the-QR-Code-Scanner-Is-Enabled"><a href="#1-Check-if-the-QR-Code-Scanner-Is-Enabled" class="headerlink" title="1.

Ensure Your Camera Is in Photo Mode"></a>2. Ensure Your Camera Is in Photo Mode</h2><p> The QR code scanner on your iPhone only works when the camera is set to Photo mode. If you’ve mistakenly switched to Video, Portrait, Pano, or any other camera mode, the QR code scanner might not work as expected. So, swipe left or right in the Camera app to switch back to Photo mode. Then, point the camera at the QR code and try to scan it again.</p><h2 id="3-Position-Your-Camera-Properly-When-Scanning"><a href="#3-Position-Your-Camera-Properly-When-Scanning" class="headerlink" title="3. Position Your Camera Properly When Scanning"></a>3. Position Your Camera Properly When Scanning</h2><p> For a quick and successful scan, make sure the QR code is positioned within the frame of your camera. Avoid scanning at steep angles, and try to keep the QR code parallel to your device. Also, ensure the QR code isn’t wrinkled, obscured, or damaged in any way, as this can prevent a successful scan.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://shop.manycam.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=17728032&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/8230bea7d54bcdf99cdfe85cb07313d5/mcaffbanner920x120.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="4-Move-Into-Better-Lighting"><a href="#4-Move-Into-Better-Lighting" class="headerlink" title="4.

A well-lit environment makes it easier for the camera to recognize and read the QR code. If you’re in a dimly lit room or area, move to a brighter spot or shine some light on the QR code to improve visibility.</p><h2 id="5-Clean-Your-Camera-Lens"><a href="#5-Clean-Your-Camera-Lens" class="headerlink" title="5. Clean Your Camera Lens"></a>5. Clean Your Camera Lens</h2><p> A smudged or dirty camera lens can make it difficult for the camera to read the QR code. So, if you are still having trouble scanning the QR code, gently wipe your camera lens with a soft, lint-free cloth to ensure it’s clean. Avoid using harsh or abrasive materials that might scratch the lens. If necessary, slightly dampen the cloth with water to remove stubborn smudges.</p><h2 id="6-Relaunch-the-Camera-App"><a href="#6-Relaunch-the-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="6. Relaunch the Camera App"></a>6. Relaunch the Camera App</h2><p> Sometimes, software glitches can cause your QR code scanner to malfunction. The quickest fix for this is to simply close the Camera app and relaunch it. To do this, swipe up from the bottom of the screen, then swipe up on the Camera app to close it. Wait for a few seconds, then reopen the<strong>Camera</strong> app and try to scan the QR code again.</p><h2 id="7-Add-Code-Scanner-to-Control-Center"><a href="#7-Add-Code-Scanner-to-Control-Center" class="headerlink" title="7. Add Code Scanner to Control Center"></a>7. Add Code Scanner to Control Center</h2><p> If you’re still having trouble using the Camera app to scan the QR code, you can add Apple’s built-in Code Scanner directly to the Control Center for easy access. This built-in feature works separately from the Camera app and can sometimes bypass issues that you might encounter while using the Camera app.</p><p>Here’s how to add the Code Scanner to the Control Center:</p><ol><li>Open the<strong>Settings</strong> app.</li><li>Scroll down and tap on<strong>Control Center</strong> .</li><li>Look for<strong>Code Scanner</strong> under the<strong>More Controls</strong> section.</li><li>Tap the<strong>plus (+)</strong> button next to<strong>Code Scanner</strong> to add it to your Control Center.</li><li>Now,<a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-use-customize-control-center-iphone/" >open the Control Center <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , then tap the<strong>Code Scanner</strong> icon to scan the QR code.</li></ol><p> When scanning in a dark or dimly lit area, tap the<strong>Flashlight</strong> icon at the bottom of the screen to <a class="link"   href="https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-turn-on-camera-flash-iphone/" >turn on your iPhone’s camera flash <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1211.jpeg"                      alt="iPhone Settings App"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4715391&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/7f687767ccf20fcea1c9dc4a5adc2326/Digisigner_banner_728_x_90_color_version.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1212.jpeg"                      alt="iPhone Control Center Settings"                ></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1213.jpeg"                      alt="iPhone Control Center With Code Scanner"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zonlipartnershipprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1596691/17882" target="_top" id="1596691"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17882-1596691"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1596691/17882"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/img_1221.jpeg"                      alt="iPhone QR Code Scanner"                ></p><p>Close</p><h2 id="8-Restart-Your-iPhone"><a href="#8-Restart-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="8.

Sometimes, minor system glitches can cause certain features, like the QR code scanner, to malfunction. Restarting your iPhone can clear these glitches and get everything running smoothly again.</p><p> However, iPhones don’t have a restart option, so you’ll have to manually turn off your device and then turn it back on. Fortunately, you can <a class="link"   href="http://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-restart-any-iphone-even-if-the-buttons-are-broken/" >manually perform a restart even if your iPhone’s buttons are broken <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> .</p><h2 id="9-Update-Your-iPhone"><a href="#9-Update-Your-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="9.

You will need your Apple ID and its code to switch off the “Find My iPhone” feature when it is enabled. You may also need it to erase your data or reactivate and utilize your device. That is to say, iCloud Activation Lock keeps your device from getting into the wrong hands.</p><p>Regarding this security plan, if you purchased a second-hand iDevice with “Find My iPhone” enabled, you would be stuck after resetting it without a passcode. Therefore, the best way is to <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 6</strong> Activation Lock to utilize the phone. You can bypass the lock but can’t eliminate the Activation Lock by iTunes.</p><p>So, to dispose of the Activation Lock, here, we will provide the best ways possible for <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong>. All the solutions mentioned here are effective and work almost 100% of the time.</p><h2 id="Part-1-4-Quick-Methods-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-6-iCloud-activation-lock"><a href="#Part-1-4-Quick-Methods-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-6-iCloud-activation-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: 4 Quick Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone 6 iCloud activation lock"></a>Part 1: 4 Quick Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone 6 iCloud activation lock</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Ask-the-previous-owner-for-Apple-ID-and-passcode"><a href="#Method-1-Ask-the-previous-owner-for-Apple-ID-and-passcode" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Ask the previous owner for Apple ID and passcode"></a>Method 1. Ask the previous owner for Apple ID and passcode</h3><p>The first thing you can do is to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-to-remove-activation-lock-without-previous-owner.html" >ask the previous owner <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for their Apple iCloud account credentials. You can use these details to open the account and use it for the <strong>Apple iPhone 6 bypass</strong>.</p><p>However, it is the least suggested and least effective method. It is because asking someone about their account details is unethical. The iCloud account has a lot of personal information about the user. Therefore, no one will be willing to hand you the account credentials unless they are your close relatives.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Ask-the-previous-owner-to-bypass-it-iCloud-remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Ask-the-previous-owner-to-bypass-it-iCloud-remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Ask the previous owner to bypass it (iCloud) remotely"></a>Method 2. Ask the previous owner to bypass it (iCloud) remotely</h3><p>The best <strong>Apple iPhone 6 bypass</strong> method is connecting with the past user and having them erase the Apple iPhone 6 from their Apple ID. The previous user can enter their password on the Activation Lock screen or access iCloud. The following are the steps that the past user ought to follow:</p><ul><li>Sign in to iCloud.com and go to Find iPhone.</li><li>Click “All Devices” from the top to open a rundown of the phones connected to their account. It will show all the phones connected to the iCloud account, regardless of whether it’s on the web. If this is a family account, it shows every accessory.</li><li>Scroll down until you find the phone you need to eliminate. Click it.</li><li>The site page will show a couple of choices for it. Click “Remove from Account” to disassociate it from iCloud.</li></ul><h3 id="Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>DNS represents the domain name and is a supportive method for bypassing the Apple iPhone 6 activation lock. It controls the DNS server and redirects the authentication way of your phone. It assists you with the Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass using these steps:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-se-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to the Wi-Fi settings and click Configure IP. Then choose Manual and click “Add Server.”</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click on the “i” and enter the DNS server IP according to your area, which is:</p><ul><li>USA: 104.154.51.7</li><li>South America: 35.199.88.219</li><li>Europe: 104.155.28.90</li><li>Asia: 104.155.220.58</li><li>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</li><li>The rest: 78.100.17.60</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Go back and turn on Wi-Fi.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Tap on Next Page and go back to bypass the lock.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Set up the gadget according to your liking.</p><p>The downside of this strategy is that it is short-term. When you reboot your iOS gadget, the activation lock comes back up, and you’ll need to do it again. That can get irritating and wasteful.</p><h3 id="Method-4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Method-4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Method 4.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 6 device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 6, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 6 device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 6 device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?</h2><p>Many third-party services claim to offer solutions to bypass iCloud activation using the IMEI number. These services propose to unlock iCloud activation by altering or manipulating the IMEI number. They promise a free and swift solution to bypass iCloud activation. Follow these steps to bypass iCloud activation using IMEI:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin with finding your device’s IMEI number. You can do it by using the *#06# code. Otherwise, you can get it from the phone box or in iPhone “Settings.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-5.jpg"                      alt="search for imei"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now access a reliable iCloud Activation lock bypassing via IMEI number service.

It’s important to note that the legitimacy and reliability of such services can vary. Keep in mind that using unofficial unlocking services may come with risks, and it’s essential to research and choose a reputable provider if you decide to pursue this option. Additionally, be cautious about potential scams and ensure that you fully understand the terms and conditions of any service you use.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1922358/21553" target="_top" id="1922358"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1922358"                      border="0" alt="" width="1080" height="1080"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1922358/21553"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?"></a>Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?</h2><p>Are you looking for a way to bypass the iCloud Activation lock without an IMEI code? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides a solution for unlocking iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch without a passcode.

Go to “Toolbox,” then choose “Screen Unlock” and select “iOS.” Next, pick “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” and click “Start” to initiate the unlocking process. Connect your iOS device using a USB cable when prompted. The window will display progress and move to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png"                      alt="start icloud activation unlock dr fone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Navigate To and Tap Unlock Now</strong></p><p>Now, you need to check whether your device is GSM or CDMA. Bypassing the iCloud Activation lock on GSM devices doesn’t affect the Apple iPhone 6 device functions. On the other hand, CDMA devices will lose the ability to be used for cellular purposes. Tap “Unlock Now,” and if you are unlocking a CDMA device, you will be presented with a warning prompt. Click “Got It” to agree to the warning and proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-6.png"                      alt="check if gsm or cdma"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Jailbreak Your Device and Complete the Process</strong></p><p>Following this, follow the on-screen instructions to jailbreak your iDevice. Once you confirm that your iOS device has been successfully jailbroken, the process initiates automatically to remove the Activation Lock. The progress is indicated by a bar displayed on the screen. Upon completion of the process, a message will appear in the window indicating the conclusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-9.png"                      alt="jailbreak and unlock ios device"                ></p><p><strong><em>For iOS 15.0~16.3</em></strong></p><p><strong>Step 1: Navigate to the Unlock Now Screen</strong></p><p>Launch Dr.Fone, tap “Toolbox,” and access “Screen Unlock” to proceed.

This feature securely stores your connected device to Apple’s activation servers. You will see an activation window on your Apple iPhone 6 when you reset your device. However, to remove the iPad activation lock, you first need to enter the connected account.</p><p>Still, there are times you might need to know how to <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 6</strong> Activation Lock. Perhaps you may fail to remember your iCloud credentials, or the screen isn’t responsive.

Ask the previous device owner for Apple ID and passcode"></a>1. Ask the previous device owner for Apple ID and passcode</h3><p>For an iPhone activation lock bypass, you’ll require a couple of data:</p><p><strong>The owner’s Apple ID email and secret word.</strong> If you want to know how to bypass Activation Lock on iPhone or iPad, it’s frequently just about as straightforward as signing into the Apple iPhone 6 device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the past owner.</p><p><strong>The owner’s four or six-digit passcodes.</strong> You might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock if a device isn’t deleted.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-xs-xr-x-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="owner id"                ></p><p>The following steps show the way to <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 6</strong> activation lock:</p><ul><li>Turn on your phone and follow the on-screen prompts to set up the Apple iPhone 6 device (language, WiFi, and so forth.)</li><li>When you see the “Sign In with Apple ID” screen, enter the Appl ID credentials of the previous owner.</li><li>With the correct credentials given, the process can proceed.</li><li>On the other hand, if you see the passcode screen, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 6 device without Apple ID.</li></ul><p>With the Apple iPhone 6 device fully set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the iCloud account.

This method is helpful when the phone owner isn’t with you and can’t sign into their Apple ID. You’ll require their Apple ID details, and they might have to verify the login activity through a different device.</p><p>Yet iCloud is a great choice for remotely bypassing a device from a client’s Apple ID. The steps below will guide the owner on how they can remotely <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 6</strong> through iCloud:</p><ul><li>Visit the official iCloud website, i.e., iCloud.com, through a web browser.</li><li>Sign in with the Mac ID details (Note: If you are performing these steps, the owner might have to verify your login is real through an iPhone or iPad related to their ID).</li><li>Select the “Find iPhone” symbol (Note: This is the “Find My” feature; Apple hasn’t changed the name on iCloud.com. However, it works for all Apple devices).</li><li>On the guide, select the blue spot related to the Apple iPhone 6 you want to sign into.</li><li>Select the “Erase iPhone” option.</li><li>Pick the “Remove from Account” option.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-xs-xr-x-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="remove from account"                ></p><h3 id="3-iForgot-website-to-reset-Apple-ID-and-passcode"><a href="#3-iForgot-website-to-reset-Apple-ID-and-passcode" class="headerlink" title="3. iForgot website to reset Apple ID and passcode"></a>3. iForgot website to reset Apple ID and passcode</h3><ul><li>Go to Apple’s iForgot site, enter your Apple ID credentials, and tap Continue.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-xs-xr-x-icloud-bypass-3.jpg"                      alt="sign in"                ></p><ul><li>Apple shows phone numbers related to the Apple ID (the numbers are covered up, and just the last two digits can be seen).

Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions.

Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner"></a>1. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner</h3><p>For an <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong>, you’ll require a couple of significant pieces of data:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 6 device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 6 passcode in mind.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="owners apple id"                ></p><p>After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 6.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 6 device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, if you see the lock screen passcode, you can type the passcode and set up the Apple iPhone 6 device without the Apple ID.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 6 device completely set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.</p><h3 id="2-Use-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2. Use DNS Bypass"></a>2. Use DNS Bypass</h3><p><strong>What is DNS?</strong></p><p>Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.</p><p>You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can’t utilize the Apple iPhone 6 device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong> via DNS bypass.</p><p><strong>Steps to Follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button&gt; More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:</p></li><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You will see the next page choice; don’t click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Look down the page, go to the menu and set up your applications, music, camera, and so forth.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Emergency-Call"><a href="#3-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="3. Emergency Call"></a>3. Emergency Call</h3><p>Utilizing the Emergency call strategy is another free <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong> method. It is among the clearest and speediest procedures to remove your iCloud account. The guidelines underneath will show you how to unlock your iCloud free by utilizing the Emergency Call technique:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn on your Apple iPhone 6. Select your preferred language and current region.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, on the iCloud activation screen, press the home button three times to begin on Voice Command and multiple times to close down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Again push on a home button, and this time select Emergency Calls.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, you need to key in *#96274825*0000*1#. Then press the call button multiple times.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Then, you need to modify the last digit from 1 to 2 and repeatedly press the call button.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Perform this strategy once more. When you adhere to every one of the guidelines, press the back button, and turn around to the starting screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now, just like you did before, select your language and country. After picking it, you will see the bypass screen.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock"></a>4.

It prevents your phone from getting used by the wrong hands. Consequently, it secures your data from getting exploited in case of theft.</p><p>However, it can be troublesome if you don’t take enough care. Your phone can get stuck on the activation lock screen if you don’t remember the password or have bought a second-hand device.</p><p>If your Apple iPhone 6 is iCloud locked, there are ways to get it unlocked. We’ll initially suggest reaching the seller. We will clear up the <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong> methods if you can’t. So sit back and relax. This detailed guide explains how to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-6-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-6-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 6 iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 6 iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><h3 id="1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner"><a href="#1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner" class="headerlink" title="1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner"></a>1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>Asking the owner about their Apple ID credentials is the first approach in this guide. You can disable the activation lock on your Apple iPhone 6 when you get those. However, this technique isn’t ensured to help you, as all of you realize that iCloud has individual data about the client.</p><p>Subsequently, no owner will want to give them to another person. In this way, you will be left without a response. It is a bad situation, so we could never propose you focus on this method for <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong>.</p><p>This method is best if the owner lives nearby, and you can meet face to face. In particular, they must know their Apple ID password. When you get together, request them to enter their Apple ID credentials, since they might be reluctant to share them via a call. It is very straightforward to remove their Apple ID and the activation lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-5-5s-5c-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="erase all content"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> When the activation lock screen appears, enter the Apple ID credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> After removing the activation lock, unpair any accessories connected to it.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Sign out of the App Store, iCloud, and iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> At last, erase all content and settings by exploring the General menu from the Settings app. Click the Reset button for the “Erase All Content and Settings” option.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2.

If you don’t know about the Apple qualifications of the past owner, then the best free strategy is to utilize a DNS bypass.

Of course, this is mainly made by Apple through iCloud or Apple ID. This system is designed to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access. This is what makes Apple’s devices highly secure and sought after.</p><p>However, a common challenge arises when you acquire a second-hand iPhone or iPad. You may find it’s connected to the previous owner’s iCloud account through an Activation Lock. This situation can be a significant hurdle, rendering the Apple iPhone 6 device almost unusable. As you may expect, this article will help you <strong>remove the iCloud Activation Lock</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg"                      alt="activation lock page ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 6 device to a specific Apple ID.</p><h3 id="Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock</h3><p>Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.</p><p>In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password"><a href="#Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password</h2><p>If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 6 device, learning <strong>how to remove iCloud Activation Lock</strong> is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.</p><p>If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 6 device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 6 device. If the Apple iPhone 6 device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to <strong>Settings &gt;</strong> Tap on the profile on top of the app &gt; <strong>Sign Out</strong>.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://store.iobit.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=1468905&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/184260348236f9554fe9375772ff966e/ascscan_728x90.png"                      border="0"                ></a></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-02.jpg"                      alt="icloud sign out button"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten your Apple ID, it can be recovered by signing in with your Apple ID account.

You get the <strong>iCloud-locked iPad</strong> and have no information about the Apple account. You can’t get the Apple ID and password. Furthermore, you don’t keep or have the receipt or proof to show the Apple Store you are the buyer of this iPad. It implies you must bypass this iCloud activation lock page for <strong>iPad and Apple iPhone 6 iCloud unlock.</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare is the right iOS unlocker you want at present.

After following these steps, your iPad and Apple iPhone 6 will turn into a normal one with no lock.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> That will remove the activation lock in a flash. Presently, your iPad and Apple iPhone 6 has no activation lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-9.png"                      alt="remove the activation lock"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Apple-iPhone-Unlock"><a href="#Method-2-Apple-iPhone-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Apple iPhone Unlock"></a>Method 2. Apple iPhone Unlock</h3><p>The Apple iPhone Unlock tool will rapidly remove the iCloud activation lock from the old user’s account. However, we are not sure if this tool will work across the globe with all variants of iOS. But this is a simple and consistent tool for removing this lock to set your own. Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Visit the Apple iPhone unlock website from a browser.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Enter the Apple iPhone 6 device IMEI or the serial number of your iPad and Apple iPhone 6 and send it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/unlock-icloud-locked-ipad-1.jpg"                      alt="enter serial number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Wait for an affirmation message informing you that the iCloud lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Presently, make another iCloud account and start using your iPad.</p><h3 id="Method-3-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>Since your iPad and Apple iPhone 6 is locked, you cannot access anything until you unlock your Apple device. One method for unlocking an iCloud-locked device is to use the DNS bypass by following the steps underneath:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Take your iPad, and remember that on the “Activate iPhone” screen, press the home button and afterward press the “Wi-Fi” settings. Close to the Wi-Fi image, tap on the “I” symbol. Now you need to change the current DNS settings of your iPad. The DNS settings you want to type are as per the following:</p><ul><li>For users in the USA, type in 104.154.51.7</li><li>In Europe, type 104.155.28.90</li><li>In Asia, type 104.155.220.58</li><li>For other parts of the world, key in 78.109.17.60</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the “Back” button, then Done. Then, click the “Activation help” option. You will see a message saying you have connected to my server whenever you do that. You will get to various iCloud services if you tap on the menu.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 6 device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 6, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 6 device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 6 device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="iCloud-Unlocker-Download-Unlock-iCloud-Lock-for-your-Apple-iPhone-6"><a href="#iCloud-Unlocker-Download-Unlock-iCloud-Lock-for-your-Apple-iPhone-6" class="headerlink" title="iCloud Unlocker Download: Unlock iCloud Lock for your Apple iPhone 6"></a>iCloud Unlocker Download: Unlock iCloud Lock for your Apple iPhone 6</h2><p>In the digital era, an iCloud account serves as a crucial tool for Apple users to store and synchronize data seamlessly. However, there are instances where users may find themselves locked out due to forgotten passwords or other reasons. In such situations, finding a secure and effective unlocking method becomes paramount. Bypassing or unlocking the iCloud lock entails some few steps which ought to be followed correctly if the code in question is to be removed properly. In this article, we’re going to take a look at three very different yet similar in action iCloud unlock methods.</p><p>The iCloud Unlocker download method brings together the downloading and installation of an iCloud lock removal software that makes it easy to bypass the iCloud lock. Though they’re contrasting in one way or the other, these methods are similar in that they both function by removing the iCloud lock feature.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Do-I-Have-to-Download-iCloud-Unlocker-to-Unlock-iCloud-Account"><a href="#Part-1-Do-I-Have-to-Download-iCloud-Unlocker-to-Unlock-iCloud-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Do I Have to Download iCloud Unlocker to Unlock iCloud Account?"></a>Part 1: Do I Have to Download iCloud Unlocker to Unlock iCloud Account?</h2><p>When it comes to unlocking the iCloud lock, many people have often wondered whether it’s possible to bypass the iCloud activation lock without necessarily downloading an iCloud unlocking software. The truth of the matter is the fact that you can bypass the iCloud lock without necessarily downloading any type of software. This has been made possible by the presence of online unlocking companies that bypass the iCloud lock.</p><h2 id="Part-2-iCloud-Unlocker-Download-iCloud-Remover"><a href="#Part-2-iCloud-Unlocker-Download-iCloud-Remover" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: iCloud Unlocker Download- iCloud Remover"></a>Part 2: iCloud Unlocker Download- iCloud Remover</h2><p>You can easily unlock iCloud account using an online method that requires you to download the iCloud unlocking software. One such method is by using the iCloud Remover software. The software functions by bypassing the iCloud activation lock and unlock iCloud lock. The time required to remove the iCloud lock depends on the make or model of your device. In general, the process takes about 3-5 business days. All you need to enjoy this service is to either submit your IMEI number to the company or download the program from their website. With this method, you can bypass iCloud lock on iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5S, 5c and iPad devices.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Unlock-iCloud-using-iCloud-Remover"><a href="#Steps-to-Unlock-iCloud-using-iCloud-Remover" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Unlock iCloud using iCloud Remover"></a>Steps to Unlock iCloud using iCloud Remover</h3><h4 id="Step-1-Log-into-the-Site"><a href="#Step-1-Log-into-the-Site" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Log into the Site"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log into the Site</h4><p>The first and foremost thing to do is to visit this website, <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >http://icloudremover.org/index.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On its interface, you’ll be in a position to see the “Download” icon located at the top-right side of your screen. It’s from this option that you will be able to download the iCloud remover software. The company, however, recommends users to first and foremost send their IMEI numbers to them so that they can confirm whether the locked device is compatible with their software or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14731090972986.jpg"                      alt="icloud unlocker download"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Unlock-iCloud-Lock"><a href="#Step-2-Unlock-iCloud-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Unlock iCloud Lock"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Unlock iCloud Lock</h4><p>Once the company has received your IMEI, they’ll email you with your device model, purchase date, warranty, and carrier lock. If your device is compatible with their method, they’ll email you containing a new email address&#x2F;account and password required to remove the iCloud lock. You’ll use this information to either go through the iCloud remover download process or simply remove the iCloud lock using the details sent to you.</p><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><p>-At $145 for the services, some users may find this method way too expensive for an iCloud unlocking service.</p><p>-You need to download the software to enjoy its services.</p><p>If you are not the type of person who wants an iCloud remover download to bypass the iCloud lock, simply turn over to the next point where you’ll get the opportunity to know how to bypass the iCloud lock without necessarily using a downloaded software.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475"                      border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-iCloud-Lock-without-Download"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-iCloud-Lock-without-Download" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock iCloud Lock without Download"></a>Part 3: Unlock iCloud Lock without Download</h2><p>The Official iPhone Unlock method happens to be the best unlock iCloud lock method that requires no software whatsoever to bypass the iCloud lock. With this method, all you need is an active internet connection, your unique IMEI number, a valid payment option and your Apple iPhone 6 or iPad make or model. You only need to spend about £19.99 ($27.00) to get your iCloud lock bypassed, unlike in our first method. The waiting period usually varies from one device to another.

Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner"></a>1. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner</h3><p>For an <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong>, you’ll require a couple of significant pieces of data:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 6 device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 6 passcode in mind.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="owners apple id"                ></p><p>After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 6.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 6 device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, if you see the lock screen passcode, you can type the passcode and set up the Apple iPhone 6 device without the Apple ID.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 6 device completely set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.</p><h3 id="2-Use-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2. Use DNS Bypass"></a>2. Use DNS Bypass</h3><p><strong>What is DNS?</strong></p><p>Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.</p><p>You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can’t utilize the Apple iPhone 6 device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong> via DNS bypass.</p><p><strong>Steps to Follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button&gt; More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:</p></li><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You will see the next page choice; don’t click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Look down the page, go to the menu and set up your applications, music, camera, and so forth.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Emergency-Call"><a href="#3-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="3. Emergency Call"></a>3. Emergency Call</h3><p>Utilizing the Emergency call strategy is another free <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong> method. It is among the clearest and speediest procedures to remove your iCloud account. The guidelines underneath will show you how to unlock your iCloud free by utilizing the Emergency Call technique:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn on your Apple iPhone 6. Select your preferred language and current region.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, on the iCloud activation screen, press the home button three times to begin on Voice Command and multiple times to close down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Again push on a home button, and this time select Emergency Calls.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, you need to key in *#96274825*0000*1#. Then press the call button multiple times.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Then, you need to modify the last digit from 1 to 2 and repeatedly press the call button.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Perform this strategy once more. When you adhere to every one of the guidelines, press the back button, and turn around to the starting screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now, just like you did before, select your language and country. After picking it, you will see the bypass screen.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock"></a>4.

It is designed to prevent unauthorized access to the Apple iPhone 6 device by linking it to the owner’s Apple ID and iCloud account. When the Activation Lock is enabled, the Apple iPhone 6 device requires the owner’s Apple ID and password to set up or restore the Apple iPhone 6 device, making it difficult for thieves to use or sell stolen iPhones. The Activation Lock ensures the Apple iPhone 6 device’s data remains secure and can only be accessed by the rightful owner.</p><p>Regardless of whether you erase your device, Activation Lock can keep on preventing anybody from reactivating your device without your consent. Regardless of whether your device is stolen, the other person will require either your device password or your Apple ID credentials to use the phone. Even if they try resetting your device through DFU mode, they will not have the option to reactivate and utilize it without <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud unlock</strong>.</p><p>However, it can create a problem for you if you’re the second owner of this device. So, if you bought this phone from someone else, you must remove the lock first. In such cases, you will need <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-6-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-6-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 6 iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 6 iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature designed to protect iPhones from unauthorized use. However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone 6 locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let’s dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone 6.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password"></a>Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password</h3><p>The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 6 and ask for their Apple ID and password. To <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 6</strong>, you need to have some data in hand:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you’re the second owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 6 passcode.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="enter icloud details"                ></p><p>After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 6 device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.</li></ul><p>However, if you see the Apple iPhone 6 passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 6 device without the iCloud account.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 6 device set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely"></a>Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely</h3><p>If the iPhone’s first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it’s time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.</p><p>However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.</p><p>So, if it’s not a stolen device, you don’t need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 6 device and <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 6</strong> by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Apple iPhone 6 devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick your Apple iPhone 6 model from there.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked. It’s as simple as that.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="remove or erase"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device’s features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 6, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.</p><p><strong>How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?</strong></p><p>A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 6 device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 6.</p><p><strong>Limitations of this Features</strong></p><p>When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn’t true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.</p><p>The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Proceed” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page.

Well, if you just bought your phone from eBay, a second-hand vendor, or a friend, the chances are that its iCloud account is locked; that is, the new user will not able able to use it unless you know the username and password of the previous owner. Luckily, there is a way to unlock the iCloud account lock on your Apple iPhone 6 if you cannot reach or convince the previous owner to reset the iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 6.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQckthGQm-8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-6-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-6-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 6 has an iCloud account lock on it?"></a>Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 6 has an iCloud account lock on it?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 6 has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.</p><p>At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html" >iCloud Activation Lock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device’s files, features, and functions.</p><p>This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html" >a second-hand iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 6 device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.</p><p>It doesn’t matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 6. Whether you <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html" >jailbreak <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html" >reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 6.</p><p>If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 6 or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Further Reading:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html" >How to sign out of Apple ID without a password? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool"></a>Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool</h2><p>iCloud Bypass Tool is an iCloud unlock tool that can help you bypass the iCloud Lock or even remove the problematic iCloud account altogether.

This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.</p><p>While this is a welcomed addition for those looking to protect their device, it can also be a major inconvenience for those who have lost or forgotten their iCloud password. Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information. You will learn in this post how to use Checkra1n iCloud bypass to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 or iPad.</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Checkra1n?"></a>Part 1: What is Checkra1n?</h2><p>Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6 or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.</p><p>Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don’t know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.</p><p>Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>The tool doesn’t require tech skills</li><li>It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices</li><li>Supports a wide range of hardware platforms</li><li>It is not possible to exploit remotely</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Jailbreaking older devices is limited</li><li>A reboot won’t save them</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?</h2><p>You may consider using Checkra1n if you are looking for a method to bypass the iCloud activation lock.

Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 6 and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html" >bypass the iCloud activation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lock.</p><h3 id="What-Does-This-Mean-for-You"><a href="#What-Does-This-Mean-for-You" class="headerlink" title="What Does This Mean for You?"></a>What Does This Mean for You?</h3><p>If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 6 device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 6 device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone 6 is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.</p><p>Now that you know everything you need to know about an iCloud-locked iPhone, read on to find out how to unlock an iCloud-locked iPhone.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPhone-iPad-iPod-Safely-and-Efficiently-iOS-12-0-16-6-Supported"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPhone-iPad-iPod-Safely-and-Efficiently-iOS-12-0-16-6-Supported" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Unlock iCloud Locked iPhone&#x2F;iPad&#x2F;iPod Safely and Efficiently?

It is designed to prevent unauthorized access to the Apple iPhone 6 device by linking it to the owner’s Apple ID and iCloud account. When the Activation Lock is enabled, the Apple iPhone 6 device requires the owner’s Apple ID and password to set up or restore the Apple iPhone 6 device, making it difficult for thieves to use or sell stolen iPhones. The Activation Lock ensures the Apple iPhone 6 device’s data remains secure and can only be accessed by the rightful owner.</p><p>Regardless of whether you erase your device, Activation Lock can keep on preventing anybody from reactivating your device without your consent. Regardless of whether your device is stolen, the other person will require either your device password or your Apple ID credentials to use the phone. Even if they try resetting your device through DFU mode, they will not have the option to reactivate and utilize it without <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud unlock</strong>.</p><p>However, it can create a problem for you if you’re the second owner of this device. So, if you bought this phone from someone else, you must remove the lock first. In such cases, you will need <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass.</strong></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://arkmc.pxf.io/c/5597632/427477/5172" target="_top" id="427477"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/5172-427477"                      border="0" alt="" width="728" height="90"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://arkmc.pxf.io/i/5597632/427477/5172"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-6-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-6-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 6 iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 6 iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature designed to protect iPhones from unauthorized use.

To <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 6</strong>, you need to have some data in hand:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you’re the second owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 6 passcode.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="enter icloud details"                ></p><p>After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 6 device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.</li></ul><p>However, if you see the Apple iPhone 6 passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 6 device without the iCloud account.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 6 device set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2.

Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely</h3><p>If the iPhone’s first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it’s time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.</p><p>However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.</p><p>So, if it’s not a stolen device, you don’t need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 6 device and <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 6</strong> by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Apple iPhone 6 devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick your Apple iPhone 6 model from there.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked.

Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device’s features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 6, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.</p><p><strong>How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?</strong></p><p>A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 6 device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 6.</p><p><strong>Limitations of this Features</strong></p><p>When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn’t true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.</p><p>The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Proceed” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page.

Well, if you just bought your phone from eBay, a second-hand vendor, or a friend, the chances are that its iCloud account is locked; that is, the new user will not able able to use it unless you know the username and password of the previous owner. Luckily, there is a way to unlock the iCloud account lock on your Apple iPhone 6 if you cannot reach or convince the previous owner to reset the iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 6.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQckthGQm-8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-6-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-6-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 6 has an iCloud account lock on it?"></a>Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 6 has an iCloud account lock on it?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 6 has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.</p><p>At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html" >iCloud Activation Lock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device’s files, features, and functions.</p><p>This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html" >a second-hand iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 6 device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.</p><p>It doesn’t matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 6. Whether you <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html" >jailbreak <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html" >reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 6.</p><p>If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 6 or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Further Reading:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html" >How to sign out of Apple ID without a password? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool"></a>Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool</h2><p>iCloud Bypass Tool is an iCloud unlock tool that can help you bypass the iCloud Lock or even remove the problematic iCloud account altogether.
