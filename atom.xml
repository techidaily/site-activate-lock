    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-14-and-iPad"><a href="#How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-14-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 14 and iPad"></a>How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 14 and iPad</h2><p>There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.</p><p>With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple"><a href="#Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple"></a>Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple</h2><p>In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 14 device happens to be the real owner, then he&#x2F;she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.</p><p>This approach, however, has a downside. It’s only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.</p><h2 id="Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock"><a href="#Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock"></a>Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock</h2><p>One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. With the help of the iCloud Activation Lock Removal process, you can easily bypass the iCloud Activation Lock and remove it completely from your device. The following is a detailed process on how you can seamlessly do it with the peace of mind that your data and all valuable information will be kept in place.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Purchase-the-Service"><a href="#Step-1-Purchase-the-Service" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Purchase the Service"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purchase the Service</h4><p>For you to unlock the iCloud lock, using this method, you first have to obtain the rights to do so. Securing these rights is simply done by purchasing their services. The price at which you’ll be charged will depend on the model of your device. To buy these services, visit <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >the webiste <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> of Official iPhoneUnlock and select “iCloud Unlock” to its “iCloud Unlock&#x2F;Activation Lock Removal” feature, then enter your IMEI number from the drop-down list as illustrated below.

This lock is crucial for preventing unauthorized use of lost or stolen devices.</p><p>Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, <strong>checking the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong> is important. Here’s how:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Power on the Apple iPhone 14 device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone 14 device has been properly erased.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone lockscreen"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> <strong>If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone 14 device still needs to be fully erased.

Well, if you just bought your phone from eBay, a second-hand vendor, or a friend, the chances are that its iCloud account is locked; that is, the new user will not able able to use it unless you know the username and password of the previous owner. Luckily, there is a way to unlock the iCloud account lock on your Apple iPhone 14 if you cannot reach or convince the previous owner to reset the iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 14.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQckthGQm-8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-14-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-14-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 14 has an iCloud account lock on it?"></a>Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 14 has an iCloud account lock on it?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 14 has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.</p><p>At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html" >iCloud Activation Lock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device’s files, features, and functions.</p><p>This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html" >a second-hand iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 14 device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.</p><p>It doesn’t matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 14. Whether you <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html" >jailbreak <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html" >reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 14.</p><p>If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 14 or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Further Reading:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html" >How to sign out of Apple ID without a password? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool"></a>Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool</h2><p>iCloud Bypass Tool is an iCloud unlock tool that can help you bypass the iCloud Lock or even remove the problematic iCloud account altogether.

Even after the Apple iPhone 14 device has been authenticated, you will still be bombarded with inquiries, and they may even want the original iOS device payment receipt.</p><p>One of the greatest free solutions to prevent these issues is to unlock your Apple iPhone utilizing iCloud DNS Bypass.

The iCloud DNS Bypass can assist you if you forget your login information (Apple ID or password) or purchase a used device with an iCloud lock activated.

Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock"><a href="#Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?"></a>Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?</h2><p>Many people have always asked me if it’s possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner"><a href="#Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner"></a>Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner</h2><p>This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 14 from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.</p><p>Sign in to the iCloud account&gt; Go to “Find My Apple iPhone 14”&gt; Select each and every device under this tab&gt; click “Erase iPhone.” Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we’ll proceed to the next step, which is to click the “Next” tab. Once we’ve done this, a new tab with “Remove Account” will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.</p><h3 id="Visit-an-Authorised-Apple-Store"><a href="#Visit-an-Authorised-Apple-Store" class="headerlink" title="Visit an Authorised Apple Store"></a>Visit an Authorised Apple Store</h3><p>You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it’s still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Jailbreak-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Jailbreak-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone</h2><p>You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-the-Software"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Download the Software"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Software</h4><p>Visit the following website <a class="link"   href="http://en.pangu.io/" >http://en.pangu.io/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and click on the “Download and Help” tab.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 14 device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 14, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 14 device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 14 device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/1853659/21526" target="_top" id="1853659"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-1853659"                      border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="750"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1853659/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code.

It prevents your phone from getting used by the wrong hands. Consequently, it secures your data from getting exploited in case of theft.</p><p>However, it can be troublesome if you don’t take enough care. Your phone can get stuck on the activation lock screen if you don’t remember the password or have bought a second-hand device.</p><p>If your Apple iPhone 14 is iCloud locked, there are ways to get it unlocked. We’ll initially suggest reaching the seller. We will clear up the <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass</strong> methods if you can’t. So sit back and relax. This detailed guide explains how to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-14-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-14-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><h3 id="1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner"><a href="#1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner" class="headerlink" title="1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner"></a>1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>Asking the owner about their Apple ID credentials is the first approach in this guide. You can disable the activation lock on your Apple iPhone 14 when you get those. However, this technique isn’t ensured to help you, as all of you realize that iCloud has individual data about the client.</p><p>Subsequently, no owner will want to give them to another person. In this way, you will be left without a response. It is a bad situation, so we could never propose you focus on this method for <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass</strong>.</p><p>This method is best if the owner lives nearby, and you can meet face to face. In particular, they must know their Apple ID password. When you get together, request them to enter their Apple ID credentials, since they might be reluctant to share them via a call. It is very straightforward to remove their Apple ID and the activation lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-5-5s-5c-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="erase all content"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> When the activation lock screen appears, enter the Apple ID credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> After removing the activation lock, unpair any accessories connected to it.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Sign out of the App Store, iCloud, and iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> At last, erase all content and settings by exploring the General menu from the Settings app. Click the Reset button for the “Erase All Content and Settings” option.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 14 device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 14, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 14 device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 14 device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?</h2><p>Many third-party services claim to offer solutions to bypass iCloud activation using the IMEI number. These services propose to unlock iCloud activation by altering or manipulating the IMEI number. They promise a free and swift solution to bypass iCloud activation. Follow these steps to bypass iCloud activation using IMEI:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin with finding your device’s IMEI number. You can do it by using the *#06# code. Otherwise, you can get it from the phone box or in iPhone “Settings.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-5.jpg"                      alt="search for imei"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now access a reliable iCloud Activation lock bypassing via IMEI number service.

It’s important to note that the legitimacy and reliability of such services can vary. Keep in mind that using unofficial unlocking services may come with risks, and it’s essential to research and choose a reputable provider if you decide to pursue this option. Additionally, be cautious about potential scams and ensure that you fully understand the terms and conditions of any service you use.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?"></a>Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?</h2><p>Are you looking for a way to bypass the iCloud Activation lock without an IMEI code? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides a solution for unlocking iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch without a passcode.

Go to “Toolbox,” then choose “Screen Unlock” and select “iOS.” Next, pick “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” and click “Start” to initiate the unlocking process. Connect your iOS device using a USB cable when prompted. The window will display progress and move to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png"                      alt="start icloud activation unlock dr fone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Navigate To and Tap Unlock Now</strong></p><p>Now, you need to check whether your device is GSM or CDMA.

Of course, this is mainly made by Apple through iCloud or Apple ID. This system is designed to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access. This is what makes Apple’s devices highly secure and sought after.</p><p>However, a common challenge arises when you acquire a second-hand iPhone or iPad. You may find it’s connected to the previous owner’s iCloud account through an Activation Lock. This situation can be a significant hurdle, rendering the Apple iPhone 14 device almost unusable. As you may expect, this article will help you <strong>remove the iCloud Activation Lock</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg"                      alt="activation lock page ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 14 device to a specific Apple ID.</p><h3 id="Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock</h3><p>Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.</p><p>In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password"><a href="#Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password"></a>Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password</h2><p>If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 14 device, learning <strong>how to remove iCloud Activation Lock</strong> is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.</p><p>If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 14 device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 14 device. If the Apple iPhone 14 device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to <strong>Settings &gt;</strong> Tap on the profile on top of the app &gt; <strong>Sign Out</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-02.jpg"                      alt="icloud sign out button"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten your Apple ID, it can be recovered by signing in with your Apple ID account. Then, click the <strong>Forgot Password</strong> button. You may need to answer security questions or receive a code on a trusted device to complete this process.</p><h3 id="Removing-Activation-Lock-via-iCloud-For-Offline-Devices"><a href="#Removing-Activation-Lock-via-iCloud-For-Offline-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)"></a>Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)</h3><p>Alternatively, you can remove the iCloud account by following the steps below. You can ask the original owner to do this or do it independently if you can access the account.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to &lt;<a class="link"   href="http://www.icloud.com/find%3E" >www.iCloud.com/find&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any web browser.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 14 device owner’s ID) and password.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-03.jpg"                      alt="login with apple id"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the list of devices associated with this Apple ID, select the one you wish to unlock.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click <strong>Remove from Account</strong>. This action will disassociate the Apple iPhone 14 device from the Apple ID, removing the Activation Lock.</li></ul><p>Following these steps, you can <strong>remove the iCloud Activation Lock</strong> from your device, provided you can access the necessary Apple ID credentials. This method is the most secure and straightforward way to regain access to your device without compromising your data or the Apple iPhone 14 device’s functionality.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-2-Remove-iCloud-Without-an-Apple-ID-Code-in-a-Few-Clicks"><a href="#Part-3-Method-2-Remove-iCloud-Without-an-Apple-ID-Code-in-a-Few-Clicks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Apple has placed the Apple iPhone 14 as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.</p><p>Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 14. We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer"><a href="#Part-1-Activation-Lock-Primer" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Activation Lock Primer"></a>Part 1: Activation Lock Primer</h2><p>Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone 14 gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.</p><p>Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-14"><a href="#Part-2-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-using-official-methods-Apple-iPhone-14" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 14)"></a>Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 14)</h2><p>An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone but forgot to erase the Apple iPhone 14 device before submitting and consequently, the Apple iPhone 14 device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that Apple iPhone 14 to make it useable again. There are a few ways you can go about it.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-Using-Apple-ID"><a href="#Method-1-Bypassing-Activation-Lock-Using-Apple-ID" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.

Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner"></a>1. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner</h3><p>For an <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass</strong>, you’ll require a couple of significant pieces of data:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 14 device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 14 passcode in mind.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="owners apple id"                ></p><p>After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 14.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 14 device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, if you see the lock screen passcode, you can type the passcode and set up the Apple iPhone 14 device without the Apple ID.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 14 device completely set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.</p><h3 id="2-Use-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2. Use DNS Bypass"></a>2. Use DNS Bypass</h3><p><strong>What is DNS?</strong></p><p>Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.</p><p>You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can’t utilize the Apple iPhone 14 device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass</strong> via DNS bypass.</p><p><strong>Steps to Follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button&gt; More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:</p></li><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You will see the next page choice; don’t click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Look down the page, go to the menu and set up your applications, music, camera, and so forth.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Emergency-Call"><a href="#3-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="3. Emergency Call"></a>3. Emergency Call</h3><p>Utilizing the Emergency call strategy is another free <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass</strong> method. It is among the clearest and speediest procedures to remove your iCloud account. The guidelines underneath will show you how to unlock your iCloud free by utilizing the Emergency Call technique:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn on your Apple iPhone 14. Select your preferred language and current region.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, on the iCloud activation screen, press the home button three times to begin on Voice Command and multiple times to close down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Again push on a home button, and this time select Emergency Calls.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, you need to key in *#96274825*0000*1#. Then press the call button multiple times.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Then, you need to modify the last digit from 1 to 2 and repeatedly press the call button.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Perform this strategy once more. When you adhere to every one of the guidelines, press the back button, and turn around to the starting screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now, just like you did before, select your language and country. After picking it, you will see the bypass screen.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock"></a>4.

It is designed to prevent unauthorized access to the Apple iPhone 14 device by linking it to the owner’s Apple ID and iCloud account. When the Activation Lock is enabled, the Apple iPhone 14 device requires the owner’s Apple ID and password to set up or restore the Apple iPhone 14 device, making it difficult for thieves to use or sell stolen iPhones. The Activation Lock ensures the Apple iPhone 14 device’s data remains secure and can only be accessed by the rightful owner.</p><p>Regardless of whether you erase your device, Activation Lock can keep on preventing anybody from reactivating your device without your consent. Regardless of whether your device is stolen, the other person will require either your device password or your Apple ID credentials to use the phone. Even if they try resetting your device through DFU mode, they will not have the option to reactivate and utilize it without <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud unlock</strong>.</p><p>However, it can create a problem for you if you’re the second owner of this device.

However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone 14 locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let’s dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone 14.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password"></a>Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password</h3><p>The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 14 and ask for their Apple ID and password. To <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 14</strong>, you need to have some data in hand:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you’re the second owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 14 passcode.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="enter icloud details"                ></p><p>After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 14 device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.</li></ul><p>However, if you see the Apple iPhone 14 passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 14 device without the iCloud account.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 14 device set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely"></a>Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely</h3><p>If the iPhone’s first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it’s time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.</p><p>However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.</p><p>So, if it’s not a stolen device, you don’t need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 14 device and <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 14</strong> by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Apple iPhone 14 devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick your Apple iPhone 14 model from there.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked.

Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device’s features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 14, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.</p><p><strong>How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?</strong></p><p>A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 14 device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 14.</p><p><strong>Limitations of this Features</strong></p><p>When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn’t true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.</p><p>The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Proceed” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page.

This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don’t have the credentials using third-party software.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vsQWFTA1UY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool"></a>Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool</h2><p>Sometimes, getting some penny spent is a great idea.

This is starting to become a thing of the past as Apple implemented two-factor authentication to secure your Apple ID.</p><p>However, it’s not always perfect, as sometimes you need to get past two-factor authentication on your iCloud for various reasons. That’s why this article will teach you how to set it up and bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud yourself if you need to. Read further to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/two-factor-authentication-intro.jpg"                      alt="everything about icloud two factor authentication"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Two-Factor-Authentication-for-iCloud"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Two-Factor-Authentication-for-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?"></a>Part 1: What Is Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?</h2><p>Not to be confused with Apple’s two-step authentication, the new and more secure two-factor authentication on iCloud introduces push notifications on your iOS device to keep your data safe. With Apple’s two unique ways to prove your identity, hackers will find it harder to access your personal and financial data.</p><p>Switching to two-factor authentication rather than two-step is becoming more common nowadays as security measures are more advanced. You can always switch your security measure at any point, but remember that two-factor authentication is now an essential way to keep your data safe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/icloud-two-factor-authentication-notification.jpg"                      alt="icloud 2 factor authentication and apple id verification"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Two-Factor-Authentication"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Two-Factor-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication?</h2><p>Setting up two-factor authentication is a secure way to protect your device against unauthorized access. Adding another layer to your username and password highly reduces the chances of hackers obtaining your account.</p><p>Here are some of the benefits of activating two-factor authentication on your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Improved security</strong> - A second form of identification aside from your password reduces the chance for someone to gain access to your information.</li><li><strong>Interconnectivity to mobile engagement</strong> - Two-factor authentication from businesses provides users with a stronger login system to ensure their information is safe in the digital world.</li><li><strong>Reduces Fraud</strong> - Due to the rise of identity theft in recent years, businesses risk losing trust, brand equity, and credibility.

On its interface, you’ll be in a position to see the “Download” icon located at the top-right side of your screen. It’s from this option that you will be able to download the iCloud remover software. The company, however, recommends users to first and foremost send their IMEI numbers to them so that they can confirm whether the locked device is compatible with their software or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14731090972986.jpg"                      alt="icloud unlocker download"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Unlock-iCloud-Lock"><a href="#Step-2-Unlock-iCloud-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Unlock iCloud Lock"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Unlock iCloud Lock</h4><p>Once the company has received your IMEI, they’ll email you with your device model, purchase date, warranty, and carrier lock.

This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.</p><p>While this is a welcomed addition for those looking to protect their device, it can also be a major inconvenience for those who have lost or forgotten their iCloud password. Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information.

As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.</p><p>Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don’t know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.</p><p>Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>The tool doesn’t require tech skills</li><li>It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices</li><li>Supports a wide range of hardware platforms</li><li>It is not possible to exploit remotely</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Jailbreaking older devices is limited</li><li>A reboot won’t save them</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?</h2><p>You may consider using Checkra1n if you are looking for a method to bypass the iCloud activation lock.

When jailbreaking a device, Checkra1n allows you to select the “Untested versions” option. While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 14 device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:</p><p><strong>Instructions.</strong> To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the “Options” and select the “Untested Versions” and “Safe Mode” options.

This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone 14 device has been properly erased.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg"                      alt="iphone lockscreen"                ></p><p><strong><strong>Note:</strong></strong> <strong>If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone 14 device still needs to be fully erased. In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone 14 device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start setting up the Apple iPhone 14 device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone 14 device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> During the setup, if the Apple iPhone 14 device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone 14 device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone 14 device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.</li></ul><p>If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an <strong>activation lock check</strong> when buying second-hand phones.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices"><a href="#Part-2-How-To-Check-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock-Status-of-Your-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices"></a>Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices</h2><p>If you’re planning to sell your Apple iPhone 14 or are curious about the status of a lost phone, you should also perform an <strong>iCloud lock check</strong>. This feature, crucial for security, can prevent a new user from accessing the phone without your permission. Here’s how you can check the status:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone"><a href="#Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Check Within the Phone"></a>Method 1: Check Within the Phone</h3><p>The first way to check your devices’ iCloud activation lock status is through the Apple iPhone 14 devices themselves. There are two ways to do this, as presented in this section.</p><h4 id="Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App"><a href="#Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App"></a>Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App</h4><p>First, open Settings on your iDevice. At the top of its menu, tap on your profile name.</p><p>If you see an iCloud account listed here and you’re signed in, your device is still linked to that iCloud account. Thus, it will still be under the iCloud Activation Lock. If there is no iCloud activation lock, it should look like this:</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-03.jpg"                      alt="iphone no icloud lock"                ></p><h4 id="Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation"><a href="#Method-1-2-Check-During-Phone-Activation" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation"></a>Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation</h4><p>If you are setting up the phone afresh or after a factory reset, proceed with the initial setup steps. Suppose the Apple iPhone 14 device asks for an Apple ID and password previously associated with the Apple iPhone 14 device at any point during the setup. In that case, it indicates that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active. This occurs if the Apple iPhone 14 device was not correctly erased before the reset.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number"><a href="#Method-2-Using-IMEI-Number" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using IMEI Number"></a>Method 2: Using IMEI Number</h3><p>Every iPhone or iPad has its own IMEI number. It can be used to check details about the Apple iPhone 14 device remotely, including <strong>checking the iCloud Activation Lock</strong>. Here are the steps to use your IMEI number to <strong>check the iCloud Activation Lock status</strong> of your phone using third-party apps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open your <strong>Settings</strong> app on the iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to <strong>General</strong>, then choose <strong>About.</strong></li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find the <strong>IMEI</strong> number by scrolling down.

Make sure to use a reputable service to avoid scams.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> On the chosen service’s website, enter your device’s IMEI number.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> The service will provide details regarding the iCloud activation lock status.</li></ul><p>Remember, if selling, always erase your device and sign out of iCloud to remove the activation lock. For buyers, always ensure your device is free from previous iCloud accounts.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Part 3: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock</h2><p>If you discover that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active on your iOS device, removing it is crucial, especially if you plan to sell or repurpose it.
