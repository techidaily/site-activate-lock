The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.</p><p>The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.</p><p>A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13&#x2F;.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.</p><p>If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?"></a>Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is lost or stolen, one of the first steps you should take is to erase the data remotely.

This is starting to become a thing of the past as Apple implemented two-factor authentication to secure your Apple ID.</p><p>However, it’s not always perfect, as sometimes you need to get past two-factor authentication on your iCloud for various reasons. That’s why this article will teach you how to set it up and bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud yourself if you need to. Read further to learn more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/two-factor-authentication-intro.jpg"                      alt="everything about icloud two factor authentication"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Two-Factor-Authentication-for-iCloud"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Two-Factor-Authentication-for-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?"></a>Part 1: What Is Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?</h2><p>Not to be confused with Apple’s two-step authentication, the new and more secure two-factor authentication on iCloud introduces push notifications on your iOS device to keep your data safe. With Apple’s two unique ways to prove your identity, hackers will find it harder to access your personal and financial data.</p><p>Switching to two-factor authentication rather than two-step is becoming more common nowadays as security measures are more advanced. You can always switch your security measure at any point, but remember that two-factor authentication is now an essential way to keep your data safe.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/icloud-two-factor-authentication-notification.jpg"                      alt="icloud 2 factor authentication and apple id verification"                ></p><h2 id="Part-2-What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Two-Factor-Authentication"><a href="#Part-2-What-Are-the-Benefits-of-Two-Factor-Authentication" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What Are the Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication?"></a>Part 2: What Are the Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication?</h2><p>Setting up two-factor authentication is a secure way to protect your device against unauthorized access. Adding another layer to your username and password highly reduces the chances of hackers obtaining your account.</p><p>Here are some of the benefits of activating two-factor authentication on your device.</p><ul><li><strong>Improved security</strong> - A second form of identification aside from your password reduces the chance for someone to gain access to your information.</li><li><strong>Interconnectivity to mobile engagement</strong> - Two-factor authentication from businesses provides users with a stronger login system to ensure their information is safe in the digital world.</li><li><strong>Reduces Fraud</strong> - Due to the rise of identity theft in recent years, businesses risk losing trust, brand equity, and credibility. A secure authentication system adds a layer of protection to keep you secure.</li></ul><h2 id="Part-3-How-To-Set-up-Two-factor-Authentication-for-iCloud"><a href="#Part-3-How-To-Set-up-Two-factor-Authentication-for-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How To Set up Two-factor Authentication for iCloud?"></a>Part 3: How To Set up Two-factor Authentication for iCloud?</h2><p>If you haven’t set up two-factor authentication yet on your iCloud, here are the steps to activate it right now.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: On your Apple iPhone 13&#x2F;iPad, go to <strong>Settings</strong> and tap your Apple ID profile at the top.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/setup-icloud-two-factor-authentication.jpg"                      alt="setup icloud 2 factor authentication iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Tap <strong>Password &amp; Security</strong> and turn On <strong>Two-Factor Authentication</strong>.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Enter a phone number to receive the two-factor code via an SMS or a phone call.</p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Enter the 6-digit verification code received on your device and wait for the process the finish.</p><p><strong>Note</strong></p><p>You can turn off two-factor authentication within two weeks of enrollment.

Tap <strong>Two-Factor Authentication</strong> and turn it <strong>Off</strong> again.</p><p>Meanwhile, here are the steps to learn how to bypass 2-step verification on iCloud on the web.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Go to the <a class="link"   href="https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin" >Apple ID <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> sign-in page and log in with your Apple ID.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Click <strong>Sign-In and Security &gt; Account Security</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/turn-off-two-factor-authentication-icloud.jpg"                      alt="setup icloud 2 factor authentication iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Click <strong>Turn Off Two-Step Verification.</strong> Answer a security question you’ve set up previously to finish the process.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Is-It-Possible-to-Bypass-Two-Factor-Authentication-for-iCloud"><a href="#Part-5-Is-It-Possible-to-Bypass-Two-Factor-Authentication-for-iCloud" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?"></a>Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?</h2><p>If you’re wondering how to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud, the answer is no, you can’t. However, if you don’t have access to your trusted device, you can have a code sent to your trusted phone number via an SMS or an automated phone call to prove to Apple that you own the iCloud account.</p><p>If this is impossible, you should request <a class="link"   href="https://iforgot.apple.com/" >account recovery <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to regain access to your account.</p><p>The easiest way to prevent this issue is by adding another phone number to your Apple ID so you’ll always have a backup.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone XR device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone XR, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone XR device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone XR device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?</h2><p>Many third-party services claim to offer solutions to bypass iCloud activation using the IMEI number.

The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.</p><p>The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.</p><p>A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13&#x2F;.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.</p><p>If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?"></a>Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 8 Plus is lost or stolen, one of the first steps you should take is to erase the data remotely.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone SE (2022) device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About.

Commence Unlocking iCloud Activation Lock Using Wondershare Dr.Fone</h3><p>Install the most recent edition of Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and open the application. Proceed to the Toolbox section, then select “Screen Unlock.” Follow it by selecting “iOS” to define the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device type. Next, opt for “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” for the intended purpose. Once directed to a new window, click on “Start” to commence the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png"                      alt="start bypassing icloud activation lock"                ></p><h3 id="Step-2-Unlocking-iOS-Devices-GSM-and-CDMA-Activation-Differences"><a href="#Step-2-Unlocking-iOS-Devices-GSM-and-CDMA-Activation-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Step 2.

Enabling DFU Mode on iOS Devices (Versions 15.0 to 16.3)</h3><p>Afterward, if your Apple device hasn’t undergone jailbreaking, the system will prompt the user to proceed with the process. Guidelines for jailbreaking are available in both written and video formats. For iOS&#x2F;iPadOS versions 16.4 to 16.6, Dr.Fone is designed to perform the jailbreaking process automatically on your device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-7.png"                      alt="jailbreak ios device"                ></p><p>Put iOS devices running versions 15.0 to 16.3 into DFU Mode following the on-screen instructions.

Upon completion, a message confirming the finished process will be displayed on the screen.

With that said, if you just purchased a used iOS device, you may be required to bypass the activation lock on your device using iCloud, or the previous user’s account. Before we take a look at how to bypass an activation lock on an Apple iPhone XS Max or iPad, let’s examine what an activation lock on an Apple iPhone XS Max or iPad entails.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/bypass-activation-lock.jpg"                      alt="bypass activation lock"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-or-iPad"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-XS-Max-or-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 1.

What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone XS Max or iPad?</h2><p>This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery. Without access to the owner’s Apple ID and&#x2F;or password, accessing the Apple iPhone XS Max device becomes impossible. Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.</p><p>This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone XS Max option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone XS Max.

It is designed to prevent unauthorized access to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device by linking it to the owner’s Apple ID and iCloud account. When the Activation Lock is enabled, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device requires the owner’s Apple ID and password to set up or restore the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, making it difficult for thieves to use or sell stolen iPhones. The Activation Lock ensures the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device’s data remains secure and can only be accessed by the rightful owner.</p><p>Regardless of whether you erase your device, Activation Lock can keep on preventing anybody from reactivating your device without your consent. Regardless of whether your device is stolen, the other person will require either your device password or your Apple ID credentials to use the phone.

However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone 14 Plus locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let’s dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.

Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device’s features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.</p><p><strong>How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?</strong></p><p>A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p><strong>Limitations of this Features</strong></p><p>When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn’t true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.</p><p>The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Proceed” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-IMEI-Code-On-Apple-iPhone-12-mini"><a href="#Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-IMEI-Code-On-Apple-iPhone-12-mini" class="headerlink" title="Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with IMEI Code On Apple iPhone 12 mini"></a>Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with IMEI Code On Apple iPhone 12 mini</h2><p>The iCloud IMEI Unlock method requires you to have your Apple iPhone 12 mini IMEI number before proceeding with the iCloud lock removal process. When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 12 mini device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 12 mini, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 12 mini device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 12 mini device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?</h2><p>Many third-party services claim to offer solutions to bypass iCloud activation using the IMEI number. These services propose to unlock iCloud activation by altering or manipulating the IMEI number. They promise a free and swift solution to bypass iCloud activation. Follow these steps to bypass iCloud activation using IMEI:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin with finding your device’s IMEI number. You can do it by using the *#06# code. Otherwise, you can get it from the phone box or in iPhone “Settings.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-5.jpg"                      alt="search for imei"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now access a reliable iCloud Activation lock bypassing via IMEI number service.

It’s important to note that the legitimacy and reliability of such services can vary. Keep in mind that using unofficial unlocking services may come with risks, and it’s essential to research and choose a reputable provider if you decide to pursue this option. Additionally, be cautious about potential scams and ensure that you fully understand the terms and conditions of any service you use.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?"></a>Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?</h2><p>Are you looking for a way to bypass the iCloud Activation lock without an IMEI code? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides a solution for unlocking iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch without a passcode.

Moreover, it can bypass the iCloud activation lock and Apple ID without requiring a password.</p><p>Additionally, it can bypass MDM (Mobile Device Management) and screen time settings without causing data loss.

Go to “Toolbox,” then choose “Screen Unlock” and select “iOS.” Next, pick “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” and click “Start” to initiate the unlocking process. Connect your iOS device using a USB cable when prompted. The window will display progress and move to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png"                      alt="start icloud activation unlock dr fone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Navigate To and Tap Unlock Now</strong></p><p>Now, you need to check whether your device is GSM or CDMA. Bypassing the iCloud Activation lock on GSM devices doesn’t affect the Apple iPhone 12 mini device functions. On the other hand, CDMA devices will lose the ability to be used for cellular purposes. Tap “Unlock Now,” and if you are unlocking a CDMA device, you will be presented with a warning prompt.

Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max passcode in mind.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="owners apple id"                ></p><p>After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen.

You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.</p><h3 id="2-Use-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2. Use DNS Bypass"></a>2. Use DNS Bypass</h3><p><strong>What is DNS?</strong></p><p>Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.</p><p>You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can’t utilize the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max iCloud bypass</strong> via DNS bypass.</p><p><strong>Steps to Follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button&gt; More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:</p></li><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You will see the next page choice; don’t click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Look down the page, go to the menu and set up your applications, music, camera, and so forth.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Emergency-Call"><a href="#3-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="3.

The guidelines underneath will show you how to unlock your iCloud free by utilizing the Emergency Call technique:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

It prevents your phone from getting used by the wrong hands. Consequently, it secures your data from getting exploited in case of theft.</p><p>However, it can be troublesome if you don’t take enough care. Your phone can get stuck on the activation lock screen if you don’t remember the password or have bought a second-hand device.</p><p>If your Apple iPhone 7 Plus is iCloud locked, there are ways to get it unlocked. We’ll initially suggest reaching the seller. We will clear up the <strong>Apple iPhone 7 Plus iCloud bypass</strong> methods if you can’t. So sit back and relax. This detailed guide explains how to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 7 Plus iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-7-Plus-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 7 Plus iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 7 Plus iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><h3 id="1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner"><a href="#1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner" class="headerlink" title="1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner"></a>1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>Asking the owner about their Apple ID credentials is the first approach in this guide. You can disable the activation lock on your Apple iPhone 7 Plus when you get those. However, this technique isn’t ensured to help you, as all of you realize that iCloud has individual data about the client.</p><p>Subsequently, no owner will want to give them to another person. In this way, you will be left without a response. It is a bad situation, so we could never propose you focus on this method for <strong>Apple iPhone 7 Plus iCloud bypass</strong>.</p><p>This method is best if the owner lives nearby, and you can meet face to face. In particular, they must know their Apple ID password. When you get together, request them to enter their Apple ID credentials, since they might be reluctant to share them via a call. It is very straightforward to remove their Apple ID and the activation lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-5-5s-5c-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="erase all content"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> When the activation lock screen appears, enter the Apple ID credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> After removing the activation lock, unpair any accessories connected to it.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Sign out of the App Store, iCloud, and iTunes.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> At last, erase all content and settings by exploring the General menu from the Settings app. Click the Reset button for the “Erase All Content and Settings” option.</li></ul><h3 id="2-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2.

This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don’t have the credentials using third-party software.</p><iframe width="100%" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vsQWFTA1UY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/05/security.svg"                      alt="Safe download"                > safe &amp; secure</p><h2 id="Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool"><a href="#Part-2-One-click-to-unlock-iCloud-ID-with-a-convenient-tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool"></a>Part 2: One-click to unlock iCloud ID with a convenient tool</h2><p>Sometimes, getting some penny spent is a great idea.

With this approach, you don’t need to use any paid service, and neither do you have to wait for days for the lock to be bypassed.</p><p>Here’s how you can unlock and bypass the iCloud Activation Lock by using the DNS change method.</p><p>1: On your iCloud Activation interface, press the “Home” button and select the “WiFi” settings option.</p><p>2: On your WiFi settings, tap on the circled “I” icon.

You will now be in a position to access features such as videos, games, iCloud Locked User Chats, and the internet.</p><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is no doubt a makeshift game-changer in the iOS platform. However, as robust and secure as it remains to be, it is no secret that this security feature can be bypassed if the right methods on how to bypass iCloud lock are employed. As seen in this article, regardless of whether you want to bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 13 mini by using the DNS change option, the Official iPhoneUnlock, or the iPhoneIMEI.net method, the fact remains that it is up to you to choose the preferred method to bypass iCloud lock when the need arises.</p><h2 id="How-to-jailbreak-iCloud-locked-Apple-iPhone-13-mini"><a href="#How-to-jailbreak-iCloud-locked-Apple-iPhone-13-mini" class="headerlink" title="How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 13 mini"></a>How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 13 mini</h2><p>Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 13 mini by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13 mini.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock"><a href="#Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?"></a>Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?</h2><p>Many people have always asked me if it’s possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner"><a href="#Part-2-Contact-the-Previous-iPhone-Owner" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner"></a>Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner</h2><p>This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 13 mini from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.</p><p>Sign in to the iCloud account&gt; Go to “Find My Apple iPhone 13 mini”&gt; Select each and every device under this tab&gt; click “Erase iPhone.” Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we’ll proceed to the next step, which is to click the “Next” tab. Once we’ve done this, a new tab with “Remove Account” will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.</p><h3 id="Visit-an-Authorised-Apple-Store"><a href="#Visit-an-Authorised-Apple-Store" class="headerlink" title="Visit an Authorised Apple Store"></a>Visit an Authorised Apple Store</h3><p>You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it’s still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Jailbreak-iPhone"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Jailbreak-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone"></a>Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone</h2><p>You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13 mini device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13 mini and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13 mini.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Download-the-Software"><a href="#Step-1-Download-the-Software" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Download the Software"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Software</h4><p>Visit the following website <a class="link"   href="http://en.pangu.io/" >http://en.pangu.io/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and click on the “Download and Help” tab. A new page with the download option will open up. The entire download is about 21MB in size. With the file downloaded, install the program on your Mac and launch it. Its interface looks like the screenshot below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736110927930.jpg"                      alt="how to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Connect-iDevice"><a href="#Step-2-Connect-iDevice" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Connect iDevice"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Connect iDevice</h4><p>Switch OFF the “Find My Apple iPhone 13 mini” feature and switch ON the “Aeroplane Mode.” Connect your Apple iPhone 13 mini to your Mac using its USB cable and click on the “Start Jailbreak” tab to initiate the jailbreaking process.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Confirmation"><a href="#Step-3-Confirmation" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Confirmation"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Confirmation</h4><p>A new interface with a screen notification will open up. Carefully read the three steps before proceeding. If you are okay with the information, click on the “Already did” icon. The jailbreaking process will begin from this point.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736112213161.jpg"                      alt="start to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h4 id="Step-4-Jailbreak-Complete"><a href="#Step-4-Jailbreak-Complete" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Jailbreak Complete"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Jailbreak Complete</h4><p>Your iPhone will reboot a number of times, which is normal.

Of course, this is mainly made by Apple through iCloud or Apple ID. This system is designed to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access. This is what makes Apple’s devices highly secure and sought after.</p><p>However, a common challenge arises when you acquire a second-hand iPhone or iPad. You may find it’s connected to the previous owner’s iCloud account through an Activation Lock. This situation can be a significant hurdle, rendering the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device almost unusable. As you may expect, this article will help you <strong>remove the iCloud Activation Lock</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg"                      alt="activation lock page ios"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-the-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device to a specific Apple ID.</p><h3 id="Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Attempting-To-Remove-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock"></a>Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock</h3><p>Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.</p><p>In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password"><a href="#Part-2-Method-1-Remove-iCloud-With-Apple-ID-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password"></a>Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password</h2><p>If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device, learning <strong>how to remove iCloud Activation Lock</strong> is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.</p><p>If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. If the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to <strong>Settings &gt;</strong> Tap on the profile on top of the app &gt; <strong>Sign Out</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-02.jpg"                      alt="icloud sign out button"                ></p><p>If you’ve forgotten your Apple ID, it can be recovered by signing in with your Apple ID account. Then, click the <strong>Forgot Password</strong> button. You may need to answer security questions or receive a code on a trusted device to complete this process.</p><h3 id="Removing-Activation-Lock-via-iCloud-For-Offline-Devices"><a href="#Removing-Activation-Lock-via-iCloud-For-Offline-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)"></a>Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)</h3><p>Alternatively, you can remove the iCloud account by following the steps below. You can ask the original owner to do this or do it independently if you can access the account.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to &lt;<a class="link"   href="http://www.icloud.com/find%3E" >www.iCloud.com/find&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> on any web browser.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device owner’s ID) and password.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-03.jpg"                      alt="login with apple id"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the list of devices associated with this Apple ID, select the one you wish to unlock.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click <strong>Remove from Account</strong>. This action will disassociate the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device from the Apple ID, removing the Activation Lock.</li></ul><p>Following these steps, you can <strong>remove the iCloud Activation Lock</strong> from your device, provided you can access the necessary Apple ID credentials. This method is the most secure and straightforward way to regain access to your device without compromising your data or the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device’s functionality.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Method-2-Remove-iCloud-Without-an-Apple-ID-Code-in-a-Few-Clicks"><a href="#Part-3-Method-2-Remove-iCloud-Without-an-Apple-ID-Code-in-a-Few-Clicks" class="headerlink" title="Part 3. Method 2: Remove iCloud Without an Apple ID Code in a Few Clicks"></a>Part 3.

In such situations, finding a secure and effective unlocking method becomes paramount. Bypassing or unlocking the iCloud lock entails some few steps which ought to be followed correctly if the code in question is to be removed properly. In this article, we’re going to take a look at three very different yet similar in action iCloud unlock methods.</p><p>The iCloud Unlocker download method brings together the downloading and installation of an iCloud lock removal software that makes it easy to bypass the iCloud lock. Though they’re contrasting in one way or the other, these methods are similar in that they both function by removing the iCloud lock feature.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Do-I-Have-to-Download-iCloud-Unlocker-to-Unlock-iCloud-Account"><a href="#Part-1-Do-I-Have-to-Download-iCloud-Unlocker-to-Unlock-iCloud-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Do I Have to Download iCloud Unlocker to Unlock iCloud Account?"></a>Part 1: Do I Have to Download iCloud Unlocker to Unlock iCloud Account?</h2><p>When it comes to unlocking the iCloud lock, many people have often wondered whether it’s possible to bypass the iCloud activation lock without necessarily downloading an iCloud unlocking software. The truth of the matter is the fact that you can bypass the iCloud lock without necessarily downloading any type of software. This has been made possible by the presence of online unlocking companies that bypass the iCloud lock.</p><h2 id="Part-2-iCloud-Unlocker-Download-iCloud-Remover"><a href="#Part-2-iCloud-Unlocker-Download-iCloud-Remover" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: iCloud Unlocker Download- iCloud Remover"></a>Part 2: iCloud Unlocker Download- iCloud Remover</h2><p>You can easily unlock iCloud account using an online method that requires you to download the iCloud unlocking software. One such method is by using the iCloud Remover software. The software functions by bypassing the iCloud activation lock and unlock iCloud lock. The time required to remove the iCloud lock depends on the make or model of your device. In general, the process takes about 3-5 business days. All you need to enjoy this service is to either submit your IMEI number to the company or download the program from their website. With this method, you can bypass iCloud lock on iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5S, 5c and iPad devices.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Unlock-iCloud-using-iCloud-Remover"><a href="#Steps-to-Unlock-iCloud-using-iCloud-Remover" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Unlock iCloud using iCloud Remover"></a>Steps to Unlock iCloud using iCloud Remover</h3><h4 id="Step-1-Log-into-the-Site"><a href="#Step-1-Log-into-the-Site" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Log into the Site"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log into the Site</h4><p>The first and foremost thing to do is to visit this website, <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >http://icloudremover.org/index.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On its interface, you’ll be in a position to see the “Download” icon located at the top-right side of your screen. It’s from this option that you will be able to download the iCloud remover software. The company, however, recommends users to first and foremost send their IMEI numbers to them so that they can confirm whether the locked device is compatible with their software or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14731090972986.jpg"                      alt="icloud unlocker download"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Unlock-iCloud-Lock"><a href="#Step-2-Unlock-iCloud-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Unlock iCloud Lock"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Unlock iCloud Lock</h4><p>Once the company has received your IMEI, they’ll email you with your device model, purchase date, warranty, and carrier lock. If your device is compatible with their method, they’ll email you containing a new email address&#x2F;account and password required to remove the iCloud lock. You’ll use this information to either go through the iCloud remover download process or simply remove the iCloud lock using the details sent to you.</p><h4 id="Cons"><a href="#Cons" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><p>-At $145 for the services, some users may find this method way too expensive for an iCloud unlocking service.</p><p>-You need to download the software to enjoy its services.</p><p>If you are not the type of person who wants an iCloud remover download to bypass the iCloud lock, simply turn over to the next point where you’ll get the opportunity to know how to bypass the iCloud lock without necessarily using a downloaded software.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-iCloud-Lock-without-Download"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-iCloud-Lock-without-Download" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock iCloud Lock without Download"></a>Part 3: Unlock iCloud Lock without Download</h2><p>The Official iPhone Unlock method happens to be the best unlock iCloud lock method that requires no software whatsoever to bypass the iCloud lock.
