One such method is the DNS change process. With this approach, you don’t need to use any paid service, and neither do you have to wait for days for the lock to be bypassed.</p><p>Here’s how you can unlock and bypass the iCloud Activation Lock by using the DNS change method.</p><p>1: On your iCloud Activation interface, press the “Home” button and select the “WiFi” settings option.</p><p>2: On your WiFi settings, tap on the circled “I” icon. This action will open the DNS settings.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14888417498764.jpg"                      alt="unlock iCloud Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus"                ></p><p>3: Enter the following DNS details depending on your location.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14888418539745.jpg"                      alt="unlock iCloud activation Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus"                ></p><p>To those located in the USA&#x2F;North America, enter 104.154.51.7.

To those in Asia and the rest of the world, enter 104.155.220.58 and 78.109.17.60 respectively.</p><p>4: Once you have entered the DNS digits, tap “Back” and finally tap on the “Done” option.</p><p>5: To temporarily bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus, tap on the “Activation Help” option. You will get a display message that reads “You have successfully connected to my server”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2017/03/14888422083505.jpg"                      alt="unlock iCloud activation Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus"                ></p><p>6: Now tap on the “Menu” option. You will now be in a position to access features such as videos, games, iCloud Locked User Chats, and the internet.</p><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is no doubt a makeshift game-changer in the iOS platform. However, as robust and secure as it remains to be, it is no secret that this security feature can be bypassed if the right methods on how to bypass iCloud lock are employed. As seen in this article, regardless of whether you want to bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus by using the DNS change option, the Official iPhoneUnlock, or the iPhoneIMEI.net method, the fact remains that it is up to you to choose the preferred method to bypass iCloud lock when the need arises.</p><h2 id="How-to-jailbreak-iCloud-locked-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus"><a href="#How-to-jailbreak-iCloud-locked-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus" class="headerlink" title="How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 14 Plus"></a>How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 14 Plus</h2><p>Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock"><a href="#Part-1-Will-Jailbreaking-Remove-iCloud-lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?"></a>Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?</h2><p>Many people have always asked me if it’s possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock.

Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors.

It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device happens to be the real owner, then he&#x2F;she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.</p><p>This approach, however, has a downside. It’s only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.</p><h2 id="Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock"><a href="#Method-3-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-via-Official-iPhoneUnlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock"></a>Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock</h2><p>One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Official iPhoneUnlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad.

Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner</h3><p>For an <strong>Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass</strong>, you’ll require a couple of significant pieces of data:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.

Use DNS Bypass</h3><p><strong>What is DNS?</strong></p><p>Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses.

This section focuses on how you can perform <strong>Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass</strong> via DNS bypass.</p><p><strong>Steps to Follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button&gt; More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:</p></li><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen.

Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To <strong>bypass iPad 3</strong> activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.</p><p>However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your iPad, go to the “Settings” application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.</p><ul><li>If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to “iCloud” and sign out.</li><li>If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click “Sign Out.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="sign out"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will request the password to your Apple account. Enter it and turn the iPad off. When done, you will not go over the activation lock screen again, and that’s how you <strong>bypass iPad 2</strong> activation lock.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Ask-the-previous-owner-for-the-lock-removal"><a href="#Method-2-Ask-the-previous-owner-for-the-lock-removal" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Ask the previous owner for the lock removal"></a>Method 2. Ask the previous owner for the lock removal</h3><p>If the previous owner failed to do this before selling the iPad to you, this shouldn’t cause an issue. But it might be a problem if they have sold you a stolen phone and don’t have the remotest clue about the Apple ID.</p><p>You don’t need to worry about the iPad activation lock if it’s a genuine phone. The past user can remotely wipe out the iPad Apple account without having the phone in their control by following these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Explore the appleid.apple.com site from a web browser and sign in with your Apple ID details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="find iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Apple iPhone 14 Plus devices tab to see every one of the connected iDevices.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Pick your iPad model from the list of devices.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Then, at that point, click the “Remove from Account” button to get it unlocked. That’s how you can perform the <strong>iPad 2&#x2F;3 and Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-3.jpg"                      alt="remove from account"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-Use-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3.

It’s likewise productive if you can’t find your iCloud username or password. The steps in DNS <strong>iPad 2 iCloud bypass</strong> are basic; here are the steps.</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your preferred language and region from the menu.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Continue” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect to Wi-Fi, search for the “I” logo near the Wi-Fi tab.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Presently, disconnect the Wi-Fi, go to “Connection Settings,” and snap “Forget this Network.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “I” and enter a DNS server IP address to bypass the iCloud activation lock. You can browse the rundown underneath as indicated by your area:</p><ul><li>USA: 104.154.51.7</li><li>South America: 35.199.88.219</li><li>Europe: 104.155.28.90</li><li>Asia: 104.155.220.58</li><li>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</li><li>Other regions of the world: 78.100.17.60</li></ul><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Click the “Back” button on the left half of your screen.

Seek Help from Apple Support"></a>Method 4. Seek Help from Apple Support</h3><p>If there are no choices for contacting the past owner of the iPad, you can ask Apple backing to assist you with the <strong>iPad 2&#x2F;3 and Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass</strong>. That may not be a simple process, but if you have the expected documents (for individuals who got verification of the purchase from the seller), Apple will be willing to help you.</p><p>One way to bypass the Find My iPhone activation lock from your iPad without the owner is to introduce proof of purchase to the Apple support group. When you give this to Apple, they can confirm the first owner of the phone and afterward can assist you with the <strong>iPad 2 iCloud bypass</strong>. After confirmation of purchase, they might request different documents, like one of your ID cards.</p><p>If you purchased the phone from your family member or somebody who has died, then your other choice to remove the lock is to show their death certificate to Apple. Apple will then, at that point, check the files and could unlock the iPad for you.</p><p>In the two cases, it depends on Apple to conclude whether they are happy with your files and if they might want to <strong>bypass iPad 2&#x2F;3 and Apple iPhone 14 Plus</strong> lock.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Bypass-iPad-4-to-iPad-7-iCloud-Activation-with-Easy"><a href="#Part-2-Bypass-iPad-4-to-iPad-7-iCloud-Activation-with-Easy" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Bypass iPad 4 to iPad 7 iCloud Activation with Easy"></a>Part 2: Bypass iPad 4 to iPad 7 iCloud Activation with Easy</h2><p>You can’t remove the iPad 4 to iPad 7 activation lock without Mac ID credentials, yet you can bypass it with an expert activation bypass tool.

Select the option of “Find My iPhone” and set it to “Off.” Provide the Apple ID password for the listed account and tap “Turn Off” to conclude.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/remove-find-my-iphone-activation-lock-without-apple-id-3.jpg"                      alt="turn-off-find-my-iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After you turn off the Find My iPhone services, the Activation Lock is automatically disabled.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Remove-find-my-iPhone-with-Apple-support"><a href="#Part-3-Remove-find-my-iPhone-with-Apple-support" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

Contacting Apple Support can be listed as one of the most prolific and conventional methods adopted to retrieve credentials and remove appropriate services readily consumed. However, to enjoy such easy services, you need to have a claim over the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. It would be both horrendous and confusing to contact Support if you have not had any control over the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device in the past years. This method might be quite easy and cost less to execute; however, you cannot cover Apple devices bought through secondhand vendors. Furthermore, by following the steps described, it is up to the Support to decide on the case and provide you with appropriate results. Few details need to be covered before contacting the Support. By calling them, they would require the following details, at most.</p><ul><li>The Apple AppleCare agreement number</li><li>The device’s serial number</li><li>The phone’s receipt</li></ul><p>By providing the following details, Apple Support may help you remove the Find My iPhone across your device and helps you configure your device easily.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/remove-find-my-iphone-activation-lock-without-apple-id-4.jpg"                      alt="contact-apple-support"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Is-it-possible-to-remove-the-activation-lock-if-it’s-a-secondhand-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-Is-it-possible-to-remove-the-activation-lock-if-it’s-a-secondhand-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4.

Is it possible to remove the activation lock if it’s a secondhand iPhone?</h2><p>Normally, it is up to the previous user with his Apple ID to provide you with the appropriate credentials to remove the activation lock across the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. For such cases, you need to contact the user himself and explain the reasons for coming up with such a situation. One easy way of confirming the credentials is by going to the locality of the user himself. With this, the phone is just a restart away, followed by the standard activation procedures that would help you remove the Activation Lock across your device.</p><p>It isn’t easy to follow these steps if you do not own the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and can’t contact the owner.

Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device’s features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.</p><p><strong>How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?</strong></p><p>A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p><strong>Limitations of this Features</strong></p><p>When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn’t true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.</p><p>The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Proceed” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect with Wi-Fi, search for the “I” icon near the Wi-Fi tab.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Disconnect the Wi-Fi, go to “Connection Settings,” and snap “Forget this Network.”</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “I” icon and enter a DNS server IP address. You can browse the IP addresses below:</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-3.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other regions: 78.100.17.60</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Presently, click the “Back” choice on the left half of your screen, turn on Wi-Fi, select your network from there, and enter your code.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="activate iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6.</strong> Click “Next Page” and snap “Back” to enter the iCloud bypass screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7.</strong> Your device will unlock, and you can access all its features now.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-quickly-with-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-For-iPhone-5S-to-iPhone-X-SE-1-running-iOS-12-0-to-iOS-16-6"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-quickly-with-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-For-iPhone-5S-to-iPhone-X-SE-1-running-iOS-12-0-to-iOS-16-6" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock quickly with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (For iPhone 5S to iPhone X&#x2F;SE 1 running iOS 12.0 to iOS 16.6)"></a>Bonus Tip: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock quickly with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (For iPhone 5S to iPhone X&#x2F;SE 1 running iOS 12.0 to iOS 16.6)</h2><p>Because of the limitations of iCloud DNS bypass and the cons of the other mentioned ways, many people tend to find a permanent solution to their issue.

Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2.

How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About.

Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device stays connected with the past owner’s iCloud account.</p><p>It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials. However, we’ve discovered a few potential ways to <strong>bypass iPad 2&#x2F;3 and Apple iPhone 14 Plus</strong>. Also, we will introduce you to the best and expert bypass tool available in the market. Therefore, we strongly suggest you stay with us and download Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock. It is safe during the process. So, how about we begin?</p><p>Explore four practical methods to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock on your iPad 2&#x2F;3 and Apple iPhone 14 Plus. These solutions help you regain access to your device and its features, enabling you to enjoy your iPad without any restrictions.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner"><a href="#Method-1-Get-Apple-ID-and-password-from-the-previous-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner"></a>Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner</h3><p>The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To <strong>bypass iPad 3</strong> activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.</p><p>However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On your iPad, go to the “Settings” application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.</p><ul><li>If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to “iCloud” and sign out.</li><li>If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click “Sign Out.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="sign out"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> It will request the password to your Apple account. Enter it and turn the iPad off.

But it might be a problem if they have sold you a stolen phone and don’t have the remotest clue about the Apple ID.</p><p>You don’t need to worry about the iPad activation lock if it’s a genuine phone. The past user can remotely wipe out the iPad Apple account without having the phone in their control by following these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Explore the appleid.apple.com site from a web browser and sign in with your Apple ID details.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="find iphone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the Apple iPhone 14 Plus devices tab to see every one of the connected iDevices.</p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Pick your iPad model from the list of devices.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Then, at that point, click the “Remove from Account” button to get it unlocked.

Well, if you just bought your phone from eBay, a second-hand vendor, or a friend, the chances are that its iCloud account is locked; that is, the new user will not able able to use it unless you know the username and password of the previous owner. Luckily, there is a way to unlock the iCloud account lock on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus if you cannot reach or convince the previous owner to reset the iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQckthGQm-8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it"><a href="#Part-1-How-do-I-know-My-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-has-an-iCloud-account-lock-on-it" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 14 Plus has an iCloud account lock on it?"></a>Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 14 Plus has an iCloud account lock on it?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 14 Plus has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.</p><p>At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html" >iCloud Activation Lock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device’s files, features, and functions.</p><p>This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html" >a second-hand iPhone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.</p><p>It doesn’t matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 14 Plus. Whether you <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html" >jailbreak <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it, <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html" >reset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p>If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.</p><p><strong>Further Reading:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/how-to-sign-out-of-apple-id-without-password.html" >How to sign out of Apple ID without a password? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-unlock-the-iCloud-account-by-iCloud-Bypass-Tool" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool"></a>Part 2: How to unlock the iCloud account by iCloud Bypass Tool</h2><p>iCloud Bypass Tool is an iCloud unlock tool that can help you bypass the iCloud Lock or even remove the problematic iCloud account altogether.

Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to <a class="link"   href="https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html" >bypass the iCloud activation <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> lock.</p><h3 id="What-Does-This-Mean-for-You"><a href="#What-Does-This-Mean-for-You" class="headerlink" title="What Does This Mean for You?"></a>What Does This Mean for You?</h3><p>If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all.

Or perhaps you have an Apple device but cannot remember your iCloud password? Without activating iCloud, you cannot utilize locked devices in either scenario.</p><p>You might try contacting Apple customer service, but they won’t be able to assist you without user identification directly. Even after the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device has been authenticated, you will still be bombarded with inquiries, and they may even want the original iOS device payment receipt.</p><p>One of the greatest free solutions to prevent these issues is to unlock your Apple iPhone utilizing iCloud DNS Bypass.

In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad.

Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab.

In such cases, you will need <strong>Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature designed to protect iPhones from unauthorized use. However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone 14 Plus locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let’s dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password"></a>Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password</h3><p>The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus and ask for their Apple ID and password. To <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 14 Plus</strong>, you need to have some data in hand:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you’re the second owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 14 Plus passcode.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="enter icloud details"                ></p><p>After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.</li></ul><p>However, if you see the Apple iPhone 14 Plus passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device without the iCloud account.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely"></a>Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely</h3><p>If the iPhone’s first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it’s time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.</p><p>However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.</p><p>So, if it’s not a stolen device, you don’t need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 14 Plus</strong> by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Apple iPhone 14 Plus devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick your Apple iPhone 14 Plus model from there.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked. It’s as simple as that.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="remove or erase"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device’s features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.</p><p><strong>How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?</strong></p><p>A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.</p><p><strong>Limitations of this Features</strong></p><p>When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn’t true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.</p><p>The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Proceed” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect with Wi-Fi, search for the “I” icon near the Wi-Fi tab.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Disconnect the Wi-Fi, go to “Connection Settings,” and snap “Forget this Network.”</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “I” icon and enter a DNS server IP address. You can browse the IP addresses below:</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://atezr.pxf.io/c/5597632/2018605/18496" target="_top" id="2018605"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18496-2018605"                      border="0" alt="" width="798" height="807"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2018605/18496"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-3.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other regions: 78.100.17.60</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Presently, click the “Back” choice on the left half of your screen, turn on Wi-Fi, select your network from there, and enter your code.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="activate iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6.</strong> Click “Next Page” and snap “Back” to enter the iCloud bypass screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7.</strong> Your device will unlock, and you can access all its features now.</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><p><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084399/18498" target="_top" id="2084399"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084399"                      border="0" alt="" width="1125" height="600"                ></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084399/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ></p><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-quickly-with-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-For-iPhone-5S-to-iPhone-X-SE-1-running-iOS-12-0-to-iOS-16-6"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-quickly-with-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-For-iPhone-5S-to-iPhone-X-SE-1-running-iOS-12-0-to-iOS-16-6" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock quickly with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (For iPhone 5S to iPhone X&#x2F;SE 1 running iOS 12.0 to iOS 16.6)"></a>Bonus Tip: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock quickly with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (For iPhone 5S to iPhone X&#x2F;SE 1 running iOS 12.0 to iOS 16.6)</h2><p>Because of the limitations of iCloud DNS bypass and the cons of the other mentioned ways, many people tend to find a permanent solution to their issue.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?</h2><p>Many third-party services claim to offer solutions to bypass iCloud activation using the IMEI number. These services propose to unlock iCloud activation by altering or manipulating the IMEI number. They promise a free and swift solution to bypass iCloud activation. Follow these steps to bypass iCloud activation using IMEI:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin with finding your device’s IMEI number. You can do it by using the *#06# code. Otherwise, you can get it from the phone box or in iPhone “Settings.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-5.jpg"                      alt="search for imei"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now access a reliable iCloud Activation lock bypassing via IMEI number service.

It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don’t know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.</p><p>Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>The tool doesn’t require tech skills</li><li>It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices</li><li>Supports a wide range of hardware platforms</li><li>It is not possible to exploit remotely</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Jailbreaking older devices is limited</li><li>A reboot won’t save them</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?</h2><p>You may consider using Checkra1n if you are looking for a method to bypass the iCloud activation lock.

However, we are not sure if this tool will work across the globe with all variants of iOS. But this is a simple and consistent tool for removing this lock to set your own. Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Visit the Apple iPhone unlock website from a browser.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Enter the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device IMEI or the serial number of your iPad and Apple iPhone 14 Plus and send it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/unlock-icloud-locked-ipad-1.jpg"                      alt="enter serial number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Wait for an affirmation message informing you that the iCloud lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Presently, make another iCloud account and start using your iPad.</p><h3 id="Method-3-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>Since your iPad and Apple iPhone 14 Plus is locked, you cannot access anything until you unlock your Apple device. One method for unlocking an iCloud-locked device is to use the DNS bypass by following the steps underneath:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Take your iPad, and remember that on the “Activate iPhone” screen, press the home button and afterward press the “Wi-Fi” settings. Close to the Wi-Fi image, tap on the “I” symbol. Now you need to change the current DNS settings of your iPad. The DNS settings you want to type are as per the following:</p><ul><li>For users in the USA, type in 104.154.51.7</li><li>In Europe, type 104.155.28.90</li><li>In Asia, type 104.155.220.58</li><li>For other parts of the world, key in 78.109.17.60</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the “Back” button, then Done. Then, click the “Activation help” option. You will see a message saying you have connected to my server whenever you do that. You will get to various iCloud services if you tap on the menu. Furthermore, you can access the User’s Chat, Mail, Social, Video, YouTube, and other things from there.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPad-and-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-with-Apple-ID-and-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPad-and-Apple-iPhone-14-Plus-with-Apple-ID-and-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Unlock iCloud Locked iPad and Apple iPhone 14 Plus with Apple ID and Password?"></a>Part 2: How to Unlock iCloud Locked iPad and Apple iPhone 14 Plus with Apple ID and Password?</h2><p>The least demanding way is to use the Apple ID username and password initially used to activate the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.
