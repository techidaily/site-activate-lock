Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner"></a>1. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner</h3><p>For an <strong>Apple iPhone 11 Pro iCloud bypass</strong>, you’ll require a couple of significant pieces of data:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 11 Pro passcode in mind.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="owners apple id"                ></p><p>After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 11 Pro iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, if you see the lock screen passcode, you can type the passcode and set up the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device without the Apple ID.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device completely set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.</p><h3 id="2-Use-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2. Use DNS Bypass"></a>2. Use DNS Bypass</h3><p><strong>What is DNS?</strong></p><p>Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.</p><p>You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can’t utilize the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform <strong>Apple iPhone 11 Pro iCloud bypass</strong> via DNS bypass.</p><p><strong>Steps to Follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button&gt; More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:</p></li><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You will see the next page choice; don’t click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Look down the page, go to the menu and set up your applications, music, camera, and so forth.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Emergency-Call"><a href="#3-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="3.

It is among the clearest and speediest procedures to remove your iCloud account. The guidelines underneath will show you how to unlock your iCloud free by utilizing the Emergency Call technique:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro. Select your preferred language and current region.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, on the iCloud activation screen, press the home button three times to begin on Voice Command and multiple times to close down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Again push on a home button, and this time select Emergency Calls.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, you need to key in *#96274825*0000*1#. Then press the call button multiple times.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Then, you need to modify the last digit from 1 to 2 and repeatedly press the call button.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Perform this strategy once more. When you adhere to every one of the guidelines, press the back button, and turn around to the starting screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now, just like you did before, select your language and country. After picking it, you will see the bypass screen.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock"></a>4.

Download New Checkra1n Version</h3><p>Crucial for a successful jailbreak is carefully selecting the <a href="https://checkra.in/"><u>appropriate Checkra1n version</u></a>. Compatibility varies across devices, making it essential to choose the version that suits your device. Error 31 issues are likely linked to the specific Checkra1n version in use. In such instances, the recommended solution is to experiment with alternative versions.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-14.jpg"                      alt="checkra1n latest version"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-4-Install-iOS-Firmware-From-iTunes-and-Retry-Jailbreaking"><a href="#Fix-4-Install-iOS-Firmware-From-iTunes-and-Retry-Jailbreaking" class="headerlink" title="Fix 4.

Install iOS Firmware From iTunes and Retry Jailbreaking</h3><p>When encountering <strong>Checkra1n jailbreak</strong>, error 31 may be attributed to the iOS version on your device. In such cases, the optimal resolution involves reinstalling the iOS version through iTunes. Follow the steps below to personally choose the IPSW file and employ iTunes for the installation on your iOS device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access the ipsw.me website using a web browser and download the compatible IPSW file for your iOS device. Before installing, ensure that the “Find My” service is disabled.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-15.jpg"                      alt="disable find my on iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Connect the iOS device to the computer and wait for iTunes&#x2F;Finder to detect it once all requirements are satisfied. For instance, if you have a Mac with the operating system before macOS Catalina, access the “Summary” tab by clicking the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device icon within iTunes. While holding the “Shift” key on Windows or the “Option” key on Mac, click “Restore iPhone.”</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-16.jpg"                      alt="restore iphone via itunes"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> You will be asked to select the IPSW file. Choose the file you downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. Once complete, re-try the jailbreaking and see if error 31 is resolved.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-17.jpg"                      alt="access file to complete installation process"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-5-Consider-Using-Other-Options-in-Checkra1n"><a href="#Fix-5-Consider-Using-Other-Options-in-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Fix 5.

Consider Using Other Options in Checkra1n</h3><p>If the reason behind <strong>Checkra1n error 31</strong> is the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device incompatibility, Checkra1n provides an inbuilt way. When jailbreaking a device, Checkra1n allows you to select the “Untested versions” option. While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:</p><p><strong>Instructions.</strong> To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the “Options” and select the “Untested Versions” and “Safe Mode” options. Then, try jailbreaking your device and see if error 31 is resolved.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-18.jpg"                      alt="enable safe mode and untested versions"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-6-Try-a-Special-Method-While-Using-Checkra1n"><a href="#Fix-6-Try-a-Special-Method-While-Using-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Fix 6.

We found a Reddit post in our search to find solutions to <strong>Checkra1n Error 31</strong>. In this post, a Reddit user explained a hack he had found to solve error 31 when jailbreaking using Checkra1n.</p><p>Remember that this hack includes a specific Checkra1n version and experience that specific user. While you can emulate the experience, the results aren’t guaranteed. Here is what that user tried for successful jailbreaking using Checkra1n:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Download and install the Checkra1n version 0.10.2 beta on your computer. Now, connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro to DFU Mode to the system. Initiate the jailbreaking process until the “Right before Trigger” option appears.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-19.jpg"                      alt="reach right before trigger screen"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> The user suggests you unplug the cable and re-plug it after waiting for 5 to 7 seconds. According to the user, this action should do the trick. To get out of DFU Mode, press and hold both buttons (Home + Lock) for 10 seconds and go on to release the home button.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-20.jpg"                      alt="exit dfu mode iphone"                ></p><h2 id="Bonus-Jailbreak-iOS-Using-Mac-A-Simple-Guide-To-Refer-To"><a href="#Bonus-Jailbreak-iOS-Using-Mac-A-Simple-Guide-To-Refer-To" class="headerlink" title="Bonus.

With that said, if you just purchased a used iOS device, you may be required to bypass the activation lock on your device using iCloud, or the previous user’s account. Before we take a look at how to bypass an activation lock on an Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad, let’s examine what an activation lock on an Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad entails.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/bypass-activation-lock.jpg"                      alt="bypass activation lock"                ></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-or-iPad"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-or-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad?"></a>Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad?</h2><p>This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery. Without access to the owner’s Apple ID and&#x2F;or password, accessing the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device becomes impossible. Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.</p><p>This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 15 Plus. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-or-iPad-with-Previous-Owner’s-Account"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Activation-Lock-on-Apple-iPhone-15-Plus-or-iPad-with-Previous-Owner’s-Account" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad with Previous Owner’s Account?</h2><p>Using a valid Apple ID and password is the easiest way to bypass the activation lock on Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad Mini. In any case, if you legitimately purchased the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device from the previous owner, they should have no qualms giving you these details. If it’s a new device, and you are the original owner, you will have this information ready to use for activation. Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad Mini.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/add-apple-id-password.jpg"                      alt="add apple id password"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Have the previous owner enter their details on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad Mini, or request them to send the same to you.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Fire up the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and when prompted on the Activation Lock Screen, enter the Apple ID and password.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Within a few minutes, the home screen should appear on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus or iPad.</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Upon reaching this page, navigate to the settings tab to sign out of iCloud.</li></ul><p><em><strong>A note for users before we proceed with the bypass steps:</strong><br>Users on iOS 12 or earlier can locate this option on settings, navigating to iCloud, then signing out.

Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner"></a>1. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner</h3><p>For an <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Plus iCloud bypass</strong>, you’ll require a couple of significant pieces of data:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 15 Plus passcode in mind.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="owners apple id"                ></p><p>After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Plus iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, if you see the lock screen passcode, you can type the passcode and set up the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device without the Apple ID.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device completely set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.</p><h3 id="2-Use-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2. Use DNS Bypass"></a>2. Use DNS Bypass</h3><p><strong>What is DNS?</strong></p><p>Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.</p><p>You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can’t utilize the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform <strong>Apple iPhone 15 Plus iCloud bypass</strong> via DNS bypass.</p><p><strong>Steps to Follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button&gt; More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:</p></li><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You will see the next page choice; don’t click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Look down the page, go to the menu and set up your applications, music, camera, and so forth.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Emergency-Call"><a href="#3-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="3.

It is among the clearest and speediest procedures to remove your iCloud account. The guidelines underneath will show you how to unlock your iCloud free by utilizing the Emergency Call technique:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus. Select your preferred language and current region.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, on the iCloud activation screen, press the home button three times to begin on Voice Command and multiple times to close down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Again push on a home button, and this time select Emergency Calls.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, you need to key in *#96274825*0000*1#. Then press the call button multiple times.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Then, you need to modify the last digit from 1 to 2 and repeatedly press the call button.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Perform this strategy once more. When you adhere to every one of the guidelines, press the back button, and turn around to the starting screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now, just like you did before, select your language and country. After picking it, you will see the bypass screen.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock"></a>4.

Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2.

In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About.

It protects your Apple devices from unauthorized access and theft. Yet, navigating this security feature can be overwhelming for users locked out of their devices. It can happen due to forgotten passwords or second-hand purchases.</p><p>Mac users often seek effective methods to bypass this security measure. They aim to reclaim access to their devices without compromising safety. This article serves as a comprehensive guide, exploring the details of bypassing the iCloud <strong>Activation Lock on Mac</strong>. It will go through various methods, strategies, and best practices to unlock your Mac.</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Mac-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Mac-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. What is Mac Activation Lock?"></a>Part 1. What is Mac Activation Lock?</h2><p><strong>Mac Activation Lock</strong>, a key part of Apple’s security, safeguards your MacBook by linking it to your Apple ID. Similar to iOS devices, it makes it tough for others to access your device without permission. Once activated, it requires your Apple ID and password for various functions. These include the likes of disabling Find My Mac, erasing the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device, or using it after a factory reset.</p><p>This feature works hand-in-hand with the ‘Find My’ app. It ensures your data’s safety even if your MacBook is lost or stolen. Only the rightful owner can disable <strong>Activation Lock Mac</strong> via their Apple ID. Yet, dealing with this security measure might be challenging for genuine users. This is especially true if they face issues like forgotten passwords or when buying a used device.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-mac-1.jpg"                      alt="mac activation lock"                ></p><p>Navigating through the iCloud <strong>Activation Lock on a MacBook</strong> can be daunting. This is especially true when faced with legitimate scenarios like forgotten passwords. It can also happen in the case of purchasing pre-owned locked devices. Yet, several methods and techniques exist to bypass this security feature. Below, we’ll go through various methods for how to bypass iCloud <strong>Activation Lock on Mac</strong>:</p><h3 id="Fix-1-Retrieve-Your-Password"><a href="#Fix-1-Retrieve-Your-Password" class="headerlink" title="Fix 1. Retrieve Your Password"></a>Fix 1. Retrieve Your Password</h3><p>Forgetting the Apple ID password can often lead to being locked out of your own device due to the iCloud Activation Lock. Fortunately, Apple provides a streamlined process to reset and retrieve forgotten passwords. This allows users to regain entry to their devices. Apple offers a mechanism to reset forgotten passwords via the Apple ID account recovery process.</p><p>Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://appleid.apple.com/sign-in" >Apple ID account page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> through a web browser on any device. Choose the option that says, “Forgot password?” and continue by following the instructions shown on the screen. You might need to answer security questions, use two-factor authentication, or receive account recovery instructions. It can happen via email or SMS to reset the password.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-mac-2.jpg"                      alt="bypass by forgetting apple id"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-2-Remove-Mac-Activation-Lock-from-Another-Device"><a href="#Fix-2-Remove-Mac-Activation-Lock-from-Another-Device" class="headerlink" title="Fix 2.

Remove Mac Activation Lock from Another Device</h3><p>When faced with a Mac locked by iCloud Activation Lock, another effective method exists. You can bypass this security measure using another trusted device. That device must be linked to the same Apple ID as the Mac. Employing this method allows you to remove the Activation Lock from the locked Mac through the “Find My” feature. Follow these steps to bypass the <strong>Mac Activation Lock</strong>:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Utilize a different Apple device, like an iPhone, iPad, or another Mac, that is currently signed in with the identical Apple ID. From there, navigate to the <a class="link"   href="https://www.icloud.com/" >iCloud website <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and sign in using your Apple account credentials.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-mac-3.jpg"                      alt="log in icloud account"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> On the iCloud website, tap the grid icon from the top right corner and select “Find My.” Here, enter your password and click on “All Devices.” Choose the locked Mac from the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device and go on to tap “Remove This Device.” Now, follow the on-screen prompts to complete the process.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-mac-4.jpg"                      alt="access find my and remove device"                ></p><h3 id="Fix-3-Ask-The-Previous-Owner-for-Help"><a href="#Fix-3-Ask-The-Previous-Owner-for-Help" class="headerlink" title="Fix 3.

The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 12 mini device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.</p><p>The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 12 mini device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 12 mini device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.</p><p>A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13&#x2F;.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.</p><p>If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-erase-data-remotely-from-your-lost-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?"></a>Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?</h2><p>If your Apple iPhone 12 mini is lost or stolen, one of the first steps you should take is to erase the data remotely.

For such cases, you need to contact the user himself and explain the reasons for coming up with such a situation. One easy way of confirming the credentials is by going to the locality of the user himself. With this, the phone is just a restart away, followed by the standard activation procedures that would help you remove the Activation Lock across your device.</p><p>It isn’t easy to follow these steps if you do not own the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device and can’t contact the owner. Under such circumstances, you have to use a third-party program. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is one of the best programs to remove an iCloud activation lock.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>The article has explained a very comprehensive set of features and tools that can be efficiently consumed to remove the Activation Lock across an iPhone for removing the Find My iPhone settings.

This is starting to become a thing of the past as Apple implemented two-factor authentication to secure your Apple ID.</p><p>However, it’s not always perfect, as sometimes you need to get past two-factor authentication on your iCloud for various reasons. That’s why this article will teach you how to set it up and bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud yourself if you need to.

When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we’re going to see as we proceed.</p><p>In this article, I’m going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKERrs5S_uU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><h2 id="Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI"><a href="#Part-1-Basic-Information-about-IMEI" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI"></a>Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI</h2><h3 id="1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code"><a href="#1-Understanding-the-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="1. Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, tap “Phone Number” under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device model.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg"                      alt="look for imei on itunes"                ></p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you’re on the “General” tab, then select “Phone Number” below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in finder"                ></p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg"                      alt="look for imei in phone box"                ></p><h3 id="3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone"><a href="#3-iCloud-IMEI-Check-for-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone"></a>3. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone</h3><p>For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-with-IMEI-Free" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?</h2><p>Many third-party services claim to offer solutions to bypass iCloud activation using the IMEI number. These services propose to unlock iCloud activation by altering or manipulating the IMEI number. They promise a free and swift solution to bypass iCloud activation. Follow these steps to bypass iCloud activation using IMEI:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Begin with finding your device’s IMEI number. You can do it by using the *#06# code. Otherwise, you can get it from the phone box or in iPhone “Settings.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-5.jpg"                      alt="search for imei"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Now access a reliable iCloud Activation lock bypassing via IMEI number service.

It’s important to note that the legitimacy and reliability of such services can vary. Keep in mind that using unofficial unlocking services may come with risks, and it’s essential to research and choose a reputable provider if you decide to pursue this option. Additionally, be cautious about potential scams and ensure that you fully understand the terms and conditions of any service you use.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-without-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?"></a>Part 3: How to Bypass iCloud Activation without IMEI Code?</h2><p>Are you looking for a way to bypass the iCloud Activation lock without an IMEI code? <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/" >Wondershare Dr.Fone <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> provides a solution for unlocking iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch without a passcode.

Go to “Toolbox,” then choose “Screen Unlock” and select “iOS.” Next, pick “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” and click “Start” to initiate the unlocking process. Connect your iOS device using a USB cable when prompted. The window will display progress and move to the next step.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png"                      alt="start icloud activation unlock dr fone"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Navigate To and Tap Unlock Now</strong></p><p>Now, you need to check whether your device is GSM or CDMA. Bypassing the iCloud Activation lock on GSM devices doesn’t affect the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device functions. On the other hand, CDMA devices will lose the ability to be used for cellular purposes. Tap “Unlock Now,” and if you are unlocking a CDMA device, you will be presented with a warning prompt. Click “Got It” to agree to the warning and proceed further.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-6.png"                      alt="check if gsm or cdma"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Jailbreak Your Device and Complete the Process</strong></p><p>Following this, follow the on-screen instructions to jailbreak your iDevice. Once you confirm that your iOS device has been successfully jailbroken, the process initiates automatically to remove the Activation Lock. The progress is indicated by a bar displayed on the screen. Upon completion of the process, a message will appear in the window indicating the conclusion.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-9.png"                      alt="jailbreak and unlock ios device"                ></p><p><strong><em>For iOS 15.0~16.3</em></strong></p><p><strong>Step 1: Navigate to the Unlock Now Screen</strong></p><p>Launch Dr.Fone, tap “Toolbox,” and access “Screen Unlock” to proceed.

With this method, you can bypass iCloud lock on iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5S, 5c and iPad devices.</p><h3 id="Steps-to-Unlock-iCloud-using-iCloud-Remover"><a href="#Steps-to-Unlock-iCloud-using-iCloud-Remover" class="headerlink" title="Steps to Unlock iCloud using iCloud Remover"></a>Steps to Unlock iCloud using iCloud Remover</h3><h4 id="Step-1-Log-into-the-Site"><a href="#Step-1-Log-into-the-Site" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Log into the Site"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log into the Site</h4><p>The first and foremost thing to do is to visit this website, <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >http://icloudremover.org/index.html <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. On its interface, you’ll be in a position to see the “Download” icon located at the top-right side of your screen. It’s from this option that you will be able to download the iCloud remover software. The company, however, recommends users to first and foremost send their IMEI numbers to them so that they can confirm whether the locked device is compatible with their software or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14731090972986.jpg"                      alt="icloud unlocker download"                ></p><h4 id="Step-2-Unlock-iCloud-Lock"><a href="#Step-2-Unlock-iCloud-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Unlock iCloud Lock"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Unlock iCloud Lock</h4><p>Once the company has received your IMEI, they’ll email you with your device model, purchase date, warranty, and carrier lock.

You’ll use this information to either go through the iCloud remover download process or simply remove the iCloud lock using the details sent to you.</p><h4 id="Cons-2"><a href="#Cons-2" class="headerlink" title="Cons"></a>Cons</h4><p>-At $145 for the services, some users may find this method way too expensive for an iCloud unlocking service.</p><p>-You need to download the software to enjoy its services.</p><p>If you are not the type of person who wants an iCloud remover download to bypass the iCloud lock, simply turn over to the next point where you’ll get the opportunity to know how to bypass the iCloud lock without necessarily using a downloaded software.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Unlock-iCloud-Lock-without-Download"><a href="#Part-3-Unlock-iCloud-Lock-without-Download" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Unlock iCloud Lock without Download"></a>Part 3: Unlock iCloud Lock without Download</h2><p>The Official iPhone Unlock method happens to be the best unlock iCloud lock method that requires no software whatsoever to bypass the iCloud lock. With this method, all you need is an active internet connection, your unique IMEI number, a valid payment option and your Apple iPhone XS or iPad make or model. You only need to spend about £19.99 ($27.00) to get your iCloud lock bypassed, unlike in our first method. The waiting period usually varies from one device to another.

The diversity of both methods allows you to easily pick and use the best method that suits your preferences.

This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.</p><p>While this is a welcomed addition for those looking to protect their device, it can also be a major inconvenience for those who have lost or forgotten their iCloud password. Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information. You will learn in this post how to use Checkra1n iCloud bypass to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max or iPad.</p><p>Let’s get started!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Checkra1n?"></a>Part 1: What is Checkra1n?</h2><p>Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.</p><p>Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don’t know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.</p><p>Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don’t know the passcode.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>The tool doesn’t require tech skills</li><li>It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices</li><li>Supports a wide range of hardware platforms</li><li>It is not possible to exploit remotely</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Jailbreaking older devices is limited</li><li>A reboot won’t save them</li></ul><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-with-Checkra1n" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?</h2><p>You may consider using Checkra1n if you are looking for a method to bypass the iCloud activation lock.

Understanding the IMEI Code"></a>1. Understanding the IMEI Code</h3><p>The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code&#x2F;number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg"                      alt="jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone"                ></p><h3 id="2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code"><a href="#2-How-to-Find-Your-IMEI-Code" class="headerlink" title="2. How to Find Your IMEI Code"></a>2. How to Find Your IMEI Code</h3><p>How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can’t locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial *#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.</p><p>You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> On your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings&gt;General&gt;About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg"                      alt="check IMEI code on iPhone"                ></p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Click the “Device” icon in iTunes to access the “Summary” tab.

In such cases, the optimal resolution involves reinstalling the iOS version through iTunes. Follow the steps below to personally choose the IPSW file and employ iTunes for the installation on your iOS device:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1.</strong> Access the ipsw.me website using a web browser and download the compatible IPSW file for your iOS device.

While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:</p><p><strong>Instructions.</strong> To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the “Options” and select the “Untested Versions” and “Safe Mode” options.

It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 6 passcode in mind.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="owners apple id"                ></p><p>After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 6.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 6 device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.</li></ul><p>On the other hand, if you see the lock screen passcode, you can type the passcode and set up the Apple iPhone 6 device without the Apple ID.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 6 device completely set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.</p><h3 id="2-Use-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#2-Use-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="2. Use DNS Bypass"></a>2. Use DNS Bypass</h3><p><strong>What is DNS?</strong></p><p>Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.</p><p>You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can’t utilize the Apple iPhone 6 device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong> via DNS bypass.</p><p><strong>Steps to Follow:</strong></p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.</li></ul><p><em><strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button&gt; More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it.</em></p><ul><li><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:</p></li><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> You will see the next page choice; don’t click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Look down the page, go to the menu and set up your applications, music, camera, and so forth.</li></ul><h3 id="3-Emergency-Call"><a href="#3-Emergency-Call" class="headerlink" title="3. Emergency Call"></a>3. Emergency Call</h3><p>Utilizing the Emergency call strategy is another free <strong>Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass</strong> method. It is among the clearest and speediest procedures to remove your iCloud account. The guidelines underneath will show you how to unlock your iCloud free by utilizing the Emergency Call technique:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Turn on your Apple iPhone 6. Select your preferred language and current region.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, on the iCloud activation screen, press the home button three times to begin on Voice Command and multiple times to close down.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Again push on a home button, and this time select Emergency Calls.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, you need to key in *#96274825*0000*1#. Then press the call button multiple times.</li><li><strong>Step 5:</strong> Then, you need to modify the last digit from 1 to 2 and repeatedly press the call button.</li><li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Perform this strategy once more. When you adhere to every one of the guidelines, press the back button, and turn around to the starting screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now, just like you did before, select your language and country. After picking it, you will see the bypass screen.</li></ul><h3 id="4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock"><a href="#4-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="4. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock"></a>4.

This feature, crucial for security, can prevent a new user from accessing the phone without your permission. Here’s how you can check the status:</p><h3 id="Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone"><a href="#Method-1-Check-Within-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Check Within the Phone"></a>Method 1: Check Within the Phone</h3><p>The first way to check your devices’ iCloud activation lock status is through the Apple iPhone 14 devices themselves. There are two ways to do this, as presented in this section.</p><h4 id="Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App"><a href="#Method-1-1-Navigating-to-the-Settings-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App"></a>Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App</h4><p>First, open Settings on your iDevice. At the top of its menu, tap on your profile name.</p><p>If you see an iCloud account listed here and you’re signed in, your device is still linked to that iCloud account.

Suppose the Apple iPhone 14 device asks for an Apple ID and password previously associated with the Apple iPhone 14 device at any point during the setup. In that case, it indicates that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active.

The Activation Lock ensures the Apple iPhone 14 device’s data remains secure and can only be accessed by the rightful owner.</p><p>Regardless of whether you erase your device, Activation Lock can keep on preventing anybody from reactivating your device without your consent. Regardless of whether your device is stolen, the other person will require either your device password or your Apple ID credentials to use the phone. Even if they try resetting your device through DFU mode, they will not have the option to reactivate and utilize it without <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud unlock</strong>.</p><p>However, it can create a problem for you if you’re the second owner of this device. So, if you bought this phone from someone else, you must remove the lock first. In such cases, you will need <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass.</strong></p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-14-iCloud-Activation-Lock"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Bypass-Apple-iPhone-14-iCloud-Activation-Lock" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 iCloud Activation Lock?"></a>Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 iCloud Activation Lock?</h2><p>The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature designed to protect iPhones from unauthorized use. However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone 14 locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let’s dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone 14.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password"><a href="#Method-1-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-for-Apple-ID-and-Password" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password"></a>Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password</h3><p>The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 14 and ask for their Apple ID and password. To <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 14</strong>, you need to have some data in hand:</p><ul><li>Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you’re the second owner.</li><li>If a device doesn’t have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 14 passcode.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg"                      alt="enter icloud details"                ></p><p>After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform <strong>Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 14 device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.</li></ul><p>However, if you see the Apple iPhone 14 passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 14 device without the iCloud account.</p><p>With the Apple iPhone 14 device set up, access your device’s Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.</p><h3 id="Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely"><a href="#Method-2-Contact-the-Previous-Device-Owner-to-Remove-Activation-Lock-Remotely" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely"></a>Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely</h3><p>If the iPhone’s first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it’s time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.</p><p>However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.</p><p>So, if it’s not a stolen device, you don’t need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 14 device and <strong>bypass Apple iPhone 14</strong> by following these steps:</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the Apple iPhone 14 devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick your Apple iPhone 14 model from there.</li><li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked. It’s as simple as that.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-2.jpg"                      alt="remove or erase"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-Use-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device’s features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 14, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.</p><p><strong>How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?</strong></p><p>A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 14 device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 14.</p><p><strong>Limitations of this Features</strong></p><p>When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn’t true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.</p><p>The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.</p><ul><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.</li><li><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click “Proceed” to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect with Wi-Fi, search for the “I” icon near the Wi-Fi tab.</li><li><strong>Step 3.</strong> Disconnect the Wi-Fi, go to “Connection Settings,” and snap “Forget this Network.”</li><li><strong>Step 4.</strong> Click the “I” icon and enter a DNS server IP address. You can browse the IP addresses below:</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-3.jpg"                      alt="dns bypass"                ></p><ul><li><p>USA: 104.154.51.7</p></li><li><p>South America: 35.199.88.219</p></li><li><p>Europe: 104.155.28.90</p></li><li><p>Asia: 104.155.220.58</p></li><li><p>Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23</p></li><li><p>Other regions: 78.100.17.60</p></li><li><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> Presently, click the “Back” choice on the left half of your screen, turn on Wi-Fi, select your network from there, and enter your code.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-4.jpg"                      alt="activate iphone"                ></p><ul><li><strong>Step 6.</strong> Click “Next Page” and snap “Back” to enter the iCloud bypass screen.</li><li><strong>Step 7.</strong> Your device will unlock, and you can access all its features now.</li></ul><h2 id="Bonus-Tip-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-quickly-with-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-For-iPhone-5S-to-iPhone-X-SE-1-running-iOS-12-0-to-iOS-16-6"><a href="#Bonus-Tip-Bypass-iCloud-Activation-Lock-quickly-with-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-For-iPhone-5S-to-iPhone-X-SE-1-running-iOS-12-0-to-iOS-16-6" class="headerlink" title="Bonus Tip: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock quickly with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (For iPhone 5S to iPhone X&#x2F;SE 1 running iOS 12.0 to iOS 16.6)"></a>Bonus Tip: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock quickly with Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (For iPhone 5S to iPhone X&#x2F;SE 1 running iOS 12.0 to iOS 16.6)</h2><p>Because of the limitations of iCloud DNS bypass and the cons of the other mentioned ways, many people tend to find a permanent solution to their issue.

It improves the security of your device. Simultaneously, it might create problems if you fail to remember your Apple ID credentials.</p><p>If you try to delete a lost iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max or set it as Lost Mode and find it back in a little while, the Activation Lock page will appear on your iPad. Also, if you purchase a second-hand iPad, it might become an <strong>iCloud-locked iPad</strong>. You should fill in the Apple ID or device password to complete the process.</p><p>With practically no credentials mentioned here, you should turn to expert software to help unlock this iPad. We will teach you <strong>how to unlock iCloud-locked iPad</strong> in different ways.</p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-We-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPad-and-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-Without-Password"><a href="#Part-1-Can-We-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPad-and-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-Without-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can We Unlock iCloud Locked iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max Without Password?"></a>Part 1: Can We Unlock iCloud Locked iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max Without Password?</h2><h3 id="Method-1-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Method-1-Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Method 1. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Method 1. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>How about we come to the most difficult situation you will be in? You get the <strong>iCloud-locked iPad</strong> and have no information about the Apple account. You can’t get the Apple ID and password. Furthermore, you don’t keep or have the receipt or proof to show the Apple Store you are the buyer of this iPad. It implies you must bypass this iCloud activation lock page for <strong>iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max iCloud unlock.</strong></p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Wondershare is the right iOS unlocker you want at present. The tool can assist you with removing the iCloud-locked interface with no password. Moreover, using Dr.Fone is not difficult; you only need to follow the steps underneath with care. And the process is safe as Dr.Fone takes care of user privacy. But you’d better have a backup because of data loss during unlock process.</p><h3 id="Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS"><a href="#Dr-Fone-Screen-Unlock-iOS" class="headerlink" title="Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)"></a>Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)</h3><p>Bypass iCloud activation lock in any scenario</p><ul><li>Forgot the password and icloud locked on iphone.</li><li>Purchased a second-hand iPhone or iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max locked to owner.</li><li>Got a gifted iPhone or iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max that is activation locked.</li><li>Device got lost or stolen and need to disable icloud activation lock.</li></ul><p><strong>3,981,454</strong> people have downloaded it</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Install the Dr.Fone application on your PC, launch it, and continue to Toolbox &gt; Screen Unlock &gt; iOS to initiate the tool for bypassing Activation Lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-1.png"                      alt="bypass activate lock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Pick the “iCloud Activation Lock Removal” option from the interface, then select the button of “Start”.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png"                      alt="bypass activate lock"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Please remember to make your iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max jailbroken; if not, the process can’t go well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-4.png"                      alt="make your device jailbroken"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Start removing the lock and wait. After following these steps, your iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max will turn into a normal one with no lock.</p><p><strong>Step 5.</strong> That will remove the activation lock in a flash. Presently, your iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max has no activation lock.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-9.png"                      alt="remove the activation lock"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Apple-iPhone-Unlock"><a href="#Method-2-Apple-iPhone-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Method 2. Apple iPhone Unlock"></a>Method 2. Apple iPhone Unlock</h3><p>The Apple iPhone Unlock tool will rapidly remove the iCloud activation lock from the old user’s account. However, we are not sure if this tool will work across the globe with all variants of iOS. But this is a simple and consistent tool for removing this lock to set your own. Here’s how:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Visit the Apple iPhone unlock website from a browser.</p><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Enter the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device IMEI or the serial number of your iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and send it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/unlock-icloud-locked-ipad-1.jpg"                      alt="enter serial number"                ></p><p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Wait for an affirmation message informing you that the iCloud lock has been removed.</p><p><strong>Step 4.</strong> Presently, make another iCloud account and start using your iPad.</p><h3 id="Method-3-iCloud-DNS-Bypass"><a href="#Method-3-iCloud-DNS-Bypass" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. iCloud DNS Bypass"></a>Method 3. iCloud DNS Bypass</h3><p>Since your iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max is locked, you cannot access anything until you unlock your Apple device. One method for unlocking an iCloud-locked device is to use the DNS bypass by following the steps underneath:</p><p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Take your iPad, and remember that on the “Activate iPhone” screen, press the home button and afterward press the “Wi-Fi” settings. Close to the Wi-Fi image, tap on the “I” symbol. Now you need to change the current DNS settings of your iPad. The DNS settings you want to type are as per the following:</p><ul><li>For users in the USA, type in 104.154.51.7</li><li>In Europe, type 104.155.28.90</li><li>In Asia, type 104.155.220.58</li><li>For other parts of the world, key in 78.109.17.60</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Click the “Back” button, then Done. Then, click the “Activation help” option. You will see a message saying you have connected to my server whenever you do that. You will get to various iCloud services if you tap on the menu. Furthermore, you can access the User’s Chat, Mail, Social, Video, YouTube, and other things from there.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPad-and-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-with-Apple-ID-and-Password"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Unlock-iCloud-Locked-iPad-and-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-with-Apple-ID-and-Password" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Unlock iCloud Locked iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max with Apple ID and Password?"></a>Part 2: How to Unlock iCloud Locked iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max with Apple ID and Password?</h2><p>The least demanding way is to use the Apple ID username and password initially used to activate the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device. Follow these steps to finish the Activation Lock bypass:</p><ul><li>Please turn on the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device and enter the first Apple ID credentials when it gets to the Activation Lock screen (or ask the individual who sold you the iPad).</li><li>It will permit the iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max to boot up. At the point when the iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max gets to the home screen, sign out of iCloud.</li></ul><p>On iOS 10.2 and older, tap Settings &gt; iCloud &gt; Sign Out.</p><p>On iOS 10.3 and newer, go to Settings and tap on your name &gt; Sign Out.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/unlock-icloud-locked-ipad-2.jpg"                      alt="sign out"                ></p><ul><li>When the iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max requests the user’s ID credentials, please enter them.</li><li>Presently, eradicate any leftover information and settings on the iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max by tapping Settings. Go to the General tab and Reset &gt; Erase All Content and Settings.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/unlock-icloud-locked-ipad-3.jpg"                      alt="erase all content"                ></p><ul><li>The iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max will restart. You shouldn’t see the Activation Lock screen this time and should have the option to set up the iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max like new.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/unlock-icloud-locked-ipad-4.jpg"                      alt="activation lock removed"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Here are the different ways you can utilize <strong>iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max iCloud unlock</strong>. If there is an opportunity to reset your Apple ID, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/" >Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> will be an incredible and straightforward choice. However, when you attempt this technique, notice that your iPad and Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max will not have the option to utilize cell data after jailbreak. So make sure to choose the method best suited for your situation.</p><h2 id="How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-and-iPad"><a href="#How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-on-your-Apple-iPhone-12-Pro-Max-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPad"></a>How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max and iPad</h2><p>There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.</p><p>With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.</p><h2 id="Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple"><a href="#Method-1-Fix-iCloud-lock-via-Apple" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple"></a>Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple</h2><p>In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.</p><h4 id="Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details"><a href="#Step-1-Enter-your-Login-Details" class="headerlink" title="Step 1: Enter your Login Details"></a><strong>Step 1:</strong> Enter your Login Details</h4><p>To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.</p><h4 id="Step-2-Find-My-iPhone"><a href="#Step-2-Find-My-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Step 2: Find My iPhone"></a><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find My iPhone</h4><p>Once you have gained access to your device, locate the “Find My iPhone” option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It’s also the main reason why you can’t access your iCloud account.</p><h4 id="Step-3-Restore-your-Device"><a href="#Step-3-Restore-your-Device" class="headerlink" title="Step 3: Restore your Device"></a><strong>Step 3:</strong> Restore your Device</h4><p>With the “Find My iPhone” option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings&gt; General&gt; Reset&gt; Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.</p><h4 id="Step-4-Sign-In"><a href="#Step-4-Sign-In" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Sign In"></a><strong>Step 4:</strong> Sign In</h4><p>With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.</p><h2 id="Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner"><a href="#Method-2-How-to-fix-iCloud-lock-through-the-owner" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner"></a>Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner</h2><p>Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy.

One way to unlock iCloud locked phone is to bypass the iCloud activation lock by following the steps below</p><p>Step 1. Take your Apple iPhone XS and while on the “Activate iPhone” screen, press the home button and then press the “Wi-Fi” settings. Next to the “Wi-Fi” symbol, tap on “i”. Now you need to change the existing DNS settings. The DNS settings you need to type are as follows:</p><ol><li>If you are in the USA type in 104.154.51.7</li><li>In Europe, type 104.155.28.90</li><li>In Asia, type 104.155.220.58</li><li>The rest of the world, please type in 78.109.17.60</li></ol><p>Step 2. Tap on the “Back” button then click “Done”. Next, click “Activation help”. Once you have done that, you will see a message that says: You have successfully connected to my server.” If you tap on the menu, you will be able to access different iCloud services such as iCloud Locked User Chat, Mail, Social, Maps, Video, YouTube, Audia, and games, among others.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-unlock-iCloud-lock-by-Apple-iPhone-Unlock"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-unlock-iCloud-lock-by-Apple-iPhone-Unlock" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to unlock iCloud lock by Apple iPhone Unlock"></a>Part 4: How to unlock iCloud lock by Apple iPhone Unlock</h2><p>Sometimes it may not be possible to completely unlock your iCloud Lock. For instance, the free method of unlocking your iCloud Lock only works on iOS 9 and iOS 8 for iPhones. Anything else will not work properly. Moreover, you may not be able to know how to unlock iCloud lock-free if you are in certain countries. That is when you can think of using the Official iPhone Unlock service which will completely unlock your Apple iPhone XS without any hassle. The iCloud Activation Lock Removal tool will quickly remove the iCloud activation lock from the previous owner’s account. In short, this is an easy and seamless tool for removing the iCloud lock to set your own.</p><p>Step 1 - Visit the <a class="link"   href="https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare" >Apple iPhone unlock <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by clicking on this link.</p><p>Step 2 - Enter the IMEI&#x2F;Serial number of your device and send it.</p><p><img src="https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14720745007162.jpg" alt="Enter your IMEI/Serial number"></p><p>Step 3 - Just wait for a confirmation message telling you that the iCloud Lock has been removed.</p><p>Step 4 - Now create a new iCloud account and start using your device</p><p>This tool works on all iPhone 6, 6+, 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4, and iPad 4, 3, 2 Air 2 and also works on iOS, and it doesn’t matter why you are unlocking it from.</p><h3 id="Wrap-it-up"><a href="#Wrap-it-up" class="headerlink" title="Wrap it up"></a>Wrap it up</h3><p>Unlike the free iCloud Lock unlock solution, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iCloud Activation Lock Removal) tool provides a permanent solution to the problem of how to unlock iCloud locked irrespective of your country. It will only cost you a couple of dollars pounds to unlock your Phone. This is a small price to pay because you might have spent hundreds of dollars to purchase a new iPhone or iPad.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"
