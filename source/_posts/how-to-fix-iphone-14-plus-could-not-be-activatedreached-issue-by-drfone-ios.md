### 2\. Use DNS Bypass

**What is DNS?**

Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.

You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can't utilize the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform **Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass** via DNS bypass.

**Steps to Follow:**

- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90

- **Step 5:** After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.

## Part 4. Method 3: Use Dedicated Third-Party Services To Remove iCloud Lock

Numerous dedicated third-party services, such as IMEICheck.co and iUnlocker.com, offer **activation lock removal** for those seeking alternative solutions. These websites typically work by using the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device’s IMEI number to unlock the associated iCloud account.

Users visit these websites, enter their device’s IMEI number, and request the iCloud unlock service. Depending on the service provider, these platforms process the unlock request, which can take a few days. While convenient, users should exercise caution and ensure they’re using reputable services to avoid potential scams.

## Conclusion

In summary, **removing iCloud Activation Lock** can be crucial for those dealing with locked Apple devices. This article has explored several methods: using the Apple ID password, leveraging the capabilities of Dr.Fone for those without the password, and opting for third-party services.

It’s important to remember that these methods should only be used for legitimate purposes, such as unlocking a device you legally own. Dr.Fone remains a recommended tool for a comprehensive mobile solution, particularly for unlocking needs.

_**Tips:** Are you searching for a powerful Unlock tool? No worries as [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare-dr-fone-unlock-android-screen/) is here to help you. Download it and start a seamless unlock experience!_
