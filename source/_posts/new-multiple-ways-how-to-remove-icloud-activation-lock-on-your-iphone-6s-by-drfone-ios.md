![activation lock page ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 6s device to a specific Apple ID.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.

## Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password

If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 6s device, learning **how to remove iCloud Activation Lock** is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.

If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 6s device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 6s device. If the Apple iPhone 6s device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to **Settings >** Tap on the profile on top of the app > **Sign Out**.

### Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)

Alternatively, you can remove the iCloud account by following the steps below. You can ask the original owner to do this or do it independently if you can access the account.

- **Step 1:** Go to <www.iCloud.com/find> on any web browser.
- **Step 2:** Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 6s device owner’s ID) and password.

## How To Bypass iCloud By Checkra1n Even On Apple iPhone 6s If You've Tried Everything

Since iOS 12.3, Apple has been using its new Activation Lock feature to deter theft. This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.

While this is a welcomed addition for those looking to protect their device, it can also be a major inconvenience for those who have lost or forgotten their iCloud password. Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information.

Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6s or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.

Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don't know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.
