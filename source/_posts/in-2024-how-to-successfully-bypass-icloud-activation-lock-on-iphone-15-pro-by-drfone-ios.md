### Fix 3. Download New Checkra1n Version

Crucial for a successful jailbreak is carefully selecting the [<u>appropriate Checkra1n version</u>](https://checkra.in/). Compatibility varies across devices, making it essential to choose the version that suits your device. Error 31 issues are likely linked to the specific Checkra1n version in use.

### Fix 4. Install iOS Firmware From iTunes and Retry Jailbreaking

When encountering **Checkra1n jailbreak**, error 31 may be attributed to the iOS version on your device. In such cases, the optimal resolution involves reinstalling the iOS version through iTunes. Follow the steps below to personally choose the IPSW file and employ iTunes for the installation on your iOS device:

- **Step 1.** Access the ipsw.me website using a web browser and download the compatible IPSW file for your iOS device. Before installing, ensure that the "Find My" service is disabled.

![disable find my on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-15.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Connect the iOS device to the computer and wait for iTunes/Finder to detect it once all requirements are satisfied. For instance, if you have a Mac with the operating system before macOS Catalina, access the "Summary" tab by clicking the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device icon within iTunes. While holding the "Shift" key on Windows or the "Option" key on Mac, click "Restore iPhone."

![restore iphone via itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-16.jpg)

### Fix 5. Consider Using Other Options in Checkra1n

If the reason behind **Checkra1n error 31** is the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device incompatibility, Checkra1n provides an inbuilt way. When jailbreaking a device, Checkra1n allows you to select the "Untested versions" option. While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:

**Instructions.** To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the "Options" and select the "Untested Versions" and "Safe Mode" options. Then, try jailbreaking your device and see if error 31 is resolved.
