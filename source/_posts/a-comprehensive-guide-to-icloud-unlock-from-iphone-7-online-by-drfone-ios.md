Nowadays, many purchase a used iPhone instead of a fresh, out-of-the-box new one. Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 7 device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 7 device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.
