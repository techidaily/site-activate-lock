## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

Third-party tools like [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) provide an effective solution when you can’t access the Apple ID passcode. Dr.Fone is recognized as an all-in-one mobile solution, catering to various needs beyond unlocking devices. It has features like recovery, [<u>system repair</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-13-black-screen.html), [<u>data transfer</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer/android-to-android-data-transfer-app.html), [<u>backup and restore</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/restore-from-icloud-backup.html), and Screen Unlock (iOS).

The Screen Unlock feature is valuable for bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock without needing the original Apple ID passcode. It’s a useful tool for those who have bought a second-hand device still tied to the previous owner’s Apple ID or have forgotten their Apple ID details.

### Method 2.1: Removing Apple ID Without Jailbreak

- **Step 1:** Download and install Wondershare Dr.Fone from the [<u>official website</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/).

### Method 2.2: Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock (Jailbreak Method)

If your device is on the activation screen, the above-presented method will not work. This is where you’ll have to jailbreak your device and **bypass the iCloud Activation Lock** with Dr.Fone. It might seem daunting. Don’t worry, as Dr.Fone will be guiding you through this. Just follow the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Toolbox > Screen Unlock > iOS**.

![dr.fone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

- **Step 3:** This time, choose **iCloud Activation Lock Removal**.

![dr.fone connect phone prompt](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-2.png)

- **Step 6:** To identify if your phone is GSM or CDMA, navigate to **Settings > General > About**. If it’s CDMA, cellular/SIM functions won’t work, but other features remain usable. Upon selecting **Unlock Now**, a warning pop-up appears. Confirm by clicking **Got it**.

![dr.fone bypass cdma warning](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-6.png)

## Part 4. Method 3: Use Dedicated Third-Party Services To Remove iCloud Lock

Numerous dedicated third-party services, such as IMEICheck.co and iUnlocker.com, offer **activation lock removal** for those seeking alternative solutions. These websites typically work by using the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device’s IMEI number to unlock the associated iCloud account.

Users visit these websites, enter their device’s IMEI number, and request the iCloud unlock service. Depending on the service provider, these platforms process the unlock request, which can take a few days. While convenient, users should exercise caution and ensure they’re using reputable services to avoid potential scams.

## Conclusion

In summary, **removing iCloud Activation Lock** can be crucial for those dealing with locked Apple devices. This article has explored several methods: using the Apple ID password, leveraging the capabilities of Dr.Fone for those without the password, and opting for third-party services.

It’s important to remember that these methods should only be used for legitimate purposes, such as unlocking a device you legally own. Dr.Fone remains a recommended tool for a comprehensive mobile solution, particularly for unlocking needs.
