Undeniably, one of Apple’s selling points is its focus on security. iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple stuff all enjoy this robust security system. Of course, this is mainly made by Apple through iCloud or Apple ID. This system is designed to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access. This is what makes Apple’s devices highly secure and sought after.

However, a common challenge arises when you acquire a second-hand iPhone or iPad. You may find it’s connected to the previous owner’s iCloud account through an Activation Lock. This situation can be a significant hurdle, rendering the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device almost unusable. As you may expect, this article will help you **remove the iCloud Activation Lock**.

![activation lock page ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device to a specific Apple ID.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.

## Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password

If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device, learning **how to remove iCloud Activation Lock** is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.

If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device. If the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to **Settings >** Tap on the profile on top of the app > **Sign Out**.

![icloud sign out button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-02.jpg)

### Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)

Alternatively, you can remove the iCloud account by following the steps below. You can ask the original owner to do this or do it independently if you can access the account.

- **Step 1:** Go to <www.iCloud.com/find> on any web browser.
- **Step 2:** Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device owner’s ID) and password.

## Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with IMEI Code On Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max

The iCloud IMEI Unlock method requires you to have your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max IMEI number before proceeding with the iCloud lock removal process. When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we're going to see as we proceed.

## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

![jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg)

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

**Method 3:** For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you're on the “General” tab, then select "Phone Number" below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

### 3\. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone

For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.

## Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?

They promise a free and swift solution to bypass iCloud activation. Follow these steps to bypass iCloud activation using IMEI:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max.

- **Step 4:** Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.

With the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device completely set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.

### 2\. Use DNS Bypass

**What is DNS?**

Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.

You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can't utilize the Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform **Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max iCloud bypass** via DNS bypass.

**Steps to Follow:**

**Note:** Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.

- **Step 1:** Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.
- **Step 2:** When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.

_**Note:** If you don't see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button> More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it._

- **Step 3:** You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.
- **Step 4:** Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90

- **Step 5:** After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.
- **Step 6:** You will see the next page choice; don't click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.

- **Step 7:** Look down the page, go to the menu and set up your applications, music, camera, and so forth.

### 3\. Emergency Call

Utilizing the Emergency call strategy is another free **Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max iCloud bypass** method. It is among the clearest and speediest procedures to remove your iCloud account. The guidelines underneath will show you how to unlock your iCloud free by utilizing the Emergency Call technique:

- **Step 1:** Turn on your Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max. Select your preferred language and current region.
- **Step 2:** Now, on the iCloud activation screen, press the home button three times to begin on Voice Command and multiple times to close down.
- **Step 3:** Again push on a home button, and this time select Emergency Calls.
- **Step 4:** Now, you need to key in \*#96274825\*0000\*1#. Then press the call button multiple times.
- **Step 5:** Then, you need to modify the last digit from 1 to 2 and repeatedly press the call button.
- **Step 6:** Perform this strategy once more. When you adhere to every one of the guidelines, press the back button, and turn around to the starting screen.
- **Step 7:** Now, just like you did before, select your language and country. After picking it, you will see the bypass screen.
