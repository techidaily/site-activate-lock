## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13/.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.

If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.

## Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?

## Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 8 Plus has an iCloud account lock on it?

If your Apple iPhone 8 Plus has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.

At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as [iCloud Activation Lock](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html). What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device's files, features, and functions.

This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy [a second-hand iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html) from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.

It doesn't matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 8 Plus. Whether you [jailbreak](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html) it, [reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html) it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 8 Plus.

If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 8 Plus or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.
