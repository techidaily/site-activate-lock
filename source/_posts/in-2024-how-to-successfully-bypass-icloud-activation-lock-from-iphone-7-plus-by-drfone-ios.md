### Step 2. Unlocking iOS Devices: GSM and CDMA Activation Differences

Follow the prompt to connect your iOS device with a USB cable. Identify if your device is GSM or CDMA. After bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device, it will work normally. However, for a CDMA device, calling and other cellular functions won't be available. As you continue unlocking the CDMA device, you'll receive step-by-step instructions. Choose the agreement option and click 'Got It!' to move forward.

### Step 3. Enabling DFU Mode on iOS Devices (Versions 15.0 to 16.3)

Afterward, if your Apple device hasn't undergone jailbreaking, the system will prompt the user to proceed with the process. Guidelines for jailbreaking are available in both written and video formats. For iOS/iPadOS versions 16.4 to 16.6, Dr.Fone is designed to perform the jailbreaking process automatically on your device.

![jailbreak ios device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-7.png)

Put iOS devices running versions 15.0 to 16.3 into DFU Mode following the on-screen instructions. After initiating DFU Mode for the first time, the program will command the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device to restart. Click the right arrow to proceed. Repeat the process to enter DFU Mode for the second time. Upon completion, the program will activate and unlock the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. Once finished, select the "Got It!" button to complete the process.

### Step 4. Complete the Activation Lock Removal Process

After confirming your jailbroken iOS device, the process initiates automatically to remove the Activation Lock. Upon completion, a message confirming the finished process will be displayed on the screen. While the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is in DFU Mode, the computer screen will show the progress of removing the iCloud **Mac Activation Lock**. Keep an eye on the progress bar until it reaches completion. Click the 'Done' button to finish unlocking the Activation Lock.
