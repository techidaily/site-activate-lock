## The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone XR from iCloud

Activation Lock is considered one of the most protective layers of any Apple device that keeps it off the hands of any user who would misuse your data. While ensuring the protection of all the data of your device, it offers a unique set of security-enhanced environment that helps you manage all your data over a single identification protocol. This identification protocol interconnects all the Apple devices with each other. Such an example can be taken from the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone XR that interconnects its structure with your Apple devices that are operating under a similar Apple ID. Under such circumstances where you accidentally lock your Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone XR iCloud, several techniques can be adapted to cover the issue efficiently. To regain your access to the iCloud of your Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone XR along with the data it holds, this article provides you with a set of instructions that can be implemented to unlock the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone XR with ease.

Major Apple connections, including iCloud, iTunes, and other identification-oriented features, require the basic Activation Lock. Furthermore, this system is not restricted to smartphones and tablets but leads onto other Apple Devices such as the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone XR.

The Find My service presented by Apple is taken further with the Activation Lock.

Activation Lock ensures that all the data present on your device is typically protected and kept safe from nefarious hands. Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone XR operates over the similar Apple ID that you have used across other devices, making its recovery and removal quite similar to the conventional methods that are adopted by people throughout the market.

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone XR device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.
