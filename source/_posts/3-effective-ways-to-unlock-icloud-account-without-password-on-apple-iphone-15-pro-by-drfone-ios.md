## Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 15 Pro has an iCloud account lock on it?

If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.

At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as [iCloud Activation Lock](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html). What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device's files, features, and functions.

This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy [a second-hand iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html) from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.

It doesn't matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. Whether you [jailbreak](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html) it, [reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html) it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 15 Pro.

If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.

While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:

**Instructions.** To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the "Options" and select the "Untested Versions" and "Safe Mode" options. Then, try jailbreaking your device and see if error 31 is resolved.

### Fix 6. Try a Special Method While Using Checkra1n

At times, the solutions you are looking for can be found among the experiences of fellow users. We found a Reddit post in our search to find solutions to **Checkra1n Error 31**. In this post, a Reddit user explained a hack he had found to solve error 31 when jailbreaking using Checkra1n.

Remember that this hack includes a specific Checkra1n version and experience that specific user. While you can emulate the experience, the results aren't guaranteed. Here is what that user tried for successful jailbreaking using Checkra1n:

- **Step 1.** Download and install the Checkra1n version 0.10.2 beta on your computer. Now, connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro to DFU Mode to the system. Initiate the jailbreaking process until the "Right before Trigger" option appears.
