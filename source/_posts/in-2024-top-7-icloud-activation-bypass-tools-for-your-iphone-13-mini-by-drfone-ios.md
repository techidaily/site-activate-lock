## How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 13 mini and iPad

There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.

With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.

## Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple

In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.

#### **Step 1:** Enter your Login Details

To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.

#### **Step 2:** Find My iPhone

Once you have gained access to your device, locate the "Find My iPhone" option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It's also the main reason why you can't access your iCloud account.

#### **Step 3:** Restore your Device

With the "Find My iPhone" option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings> General> Reset> Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.

#### **Step 4:** Sign In

With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.

## Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner

Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 13 mini device happens to be the real owner, then he/she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.

This approach, however, has a downside. It's only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.

## Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock

One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the [Official iPhoneUnlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare).

The following is a detailed process on how you can seamlessly do it with the peace of mind that your data and all valuable information will be kept in place.

#### **Step 1:** Purchase the Service

For you to unlock the iCloud lock, using this method, you first have to obtain the rights to do so. Securing these rights is simply done by purchasing their services. The price at which you’ll be charged will depend on the model of your device. To buy these services, visit [the webiste](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) of Official iPhoneUnlock and select "iCloud Unlock" to its "iCloud Unlock/Activation Lock Removal" feature, then enter your IMEI number from the drop-down list as illustrated below. Once you have located your phone make or model, click on the "Add to Cart" tab. The price at which you are going to be charged will be displayed on your right-hand side.

![fix icloud lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719794951413.jpg)

Choose your best-preferred method by clicking on the "Pay with Credit or Debit Card" tab and enter your bank details. Once you submit your payment, your iCloud lock will be unlocked after a period of between 2-3 days. A confirmation email will be sent to your designated email address.

## Latest Guide on iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 13 mini iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

Nowadays, many purchase a used iPhone instead of a fresh, out-of-the-box new one. Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 13 mini device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 13 mini device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.

It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials. However, we've discovered a few potential ways to **bypass iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 13 mini**. Also, we will introduce you to the best and expert bypass tool available in the market. Therefore, we strongly suggest you stay with us and download Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock. It is safe during the process. So, how about we begin?

Explore four practical methods to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock on your iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 13 mini. These solutions help you regain access to your device and its features, enabling you to enjoy your iPad without any restrictions.

### Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner

The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To **bypass iPad 3** activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 13 mini device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.

However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 13 mini device.

**Step 2.** On your iPad, go to the "Settings" application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.

- If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to "iCloud" and sign out.
- If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click "Sign Out."

![sign out](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

**Step 3.** It will request the password to your Apple account. Enter it and turn the iPad off. When done, you will not go over the activation lock screen again, and that's how you **bypass iPad 2** activation lock.

### Method 2. Ask the previous owner for the lock removal

If the previous owner failed to do this before selling the iPad to you, this shouldn't cause an issue. But it might be a problem if they have sold you a stolen phone and don't have the remotest clue about the Apple ID.

You don't need to worry about the iPad activation lock if it's a genuine phone. The past user can remotely wipe out the iPad Apple account without having the phone in their control by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Explore the appleid.apple.com site from a web browser and sign in with your Apple ID details.

![find iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-2.jpg)

That may not be a simple process, but if you have the expected documents (for individuals who got verification of the purchase from the seller), Apple will be willing to help you.

One way to bypass the Find My iPhone activation lock from your iPad without the owner is to introduce proof of purchase to the Apple support group. When you give this to Apple, they can confirm the first owner of the phone and afterward can assist you with the **iPad 2 iCloud bypass**.

In the two cases, it depends on Apple to conclude whether they are happy with your files and if they might want to **bypass iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 13 mini** lock.
