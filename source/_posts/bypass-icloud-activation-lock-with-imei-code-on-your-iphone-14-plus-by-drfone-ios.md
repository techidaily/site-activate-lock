## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

In such a situation, you need to be well-informed of the methods or techniques you can use to **bypass the Activation Lock**. This article will provide you with a basic understanding of Activation Lock and how you can remove it.

## Part 1: What is Activation Lock?

Apple Find My \[device\] presents a single feature of Activation Lock that turns on impulsively whenever Find My \[device\] seems activated. The responsibility of these features is to ensure that the data available in your Apple iPhone 14 Plus is kept safe and secure and avoid reactivating the data even after erasing it.

### Working of Activation Lock

Whenever the Apple Silicon or T2 security chip is activated in iPod, iPhone, iPad, Mac, or etc., the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device confirms that the Activation Lock is activated by contacting Apple. The time you set “Find My”, your Apple ID is securely stored and linked to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device by Apple.

## Part 2: How to Bypass the Activation Lock on iPhone or iPad
