## Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to a specific Apple ID.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.

## Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password

If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, learning **how to remove iCloud Activation Lock** is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.

If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to **Settings >** Tap on the profile on top of the app > **Sign Out**.

- **Step 1:** Go to <www.iCloud.com/find> on any web browser.
- **Step 2:** Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device owner’s ID) and password.

You can turn off two-factor authentication within two weeks of enrollment. After that, it's permanent.

## Part 4: How To Turn Off Two-Factor Authentication on Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max?

As previously stated, once two-factor authentication is active on iCloud, you only have a two-week window to deactivate it again.

To get past two-factor authentication on iCloud, Go to **Settings** > **your name** > **Password & Security**. Tap **Two-Factor Authentication** and turn it **Off** again.

Meanwhile, here are the steps to learn how to bypass 2-step verification on iCloud on the web.

**Step 1**: Go to the [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin) sign-in page and log in with your Apple ID.

**Step 2**: Click **Sign-In and Security > Account Security**.

![setup icloud 2 factor authentication iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/turn-off-two-factor-authentication-icloud.jpg)

**Step 3**: Click **Turn Off Two-Step Verification.** Answer a security question you've set up previously to finish the process.

## Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you're wondering how to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud, the answer is no, you can't. However, if you don't have access to your trusted device, you can have a code sent to your trusted phone number via an SMS or an automated phone call to prove to Apple that you own the iCloud account.

If this is impossible, you should request [account recovery](https://iforgot.apple.com/) to regain access to your account.

The easiest way to prevent this issue is by adding another phone number to your Apple ID so you'll always have a backup. Here's how.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, go to **Settings** and tap on your **Apple ID** > **Password & Security**.

**Step 2**: Tap **Edit** and choose to **Add a Trusted Phone Number**. You'll have to enter your device's passcode to continue.

![add trusted phone number apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/add-trusted-phone-number-icloud.jpg)

**Step 3**: Enter your new phone number. Select a way to receive a verification code via sms or phone call and tap **Send**.

**Step 4**: Enter the verification code and wait for the process to finish.

## Bonus Tips: Forgot Your iCloud Password? Here's What To Do

Using special programs like [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) can help you recover your iOS device if you forget your iCloud password.

Dr.Fone's key features are:

- Removes all types of iPhone locks such as Apple ID password, Face ID, Touch ID, and more.
- Bypass iCloud activation lock.
- Unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without carrier restrictions.
- Remove MDM profile / bypass MDM lock without data loss.


Here's how to use Dr.Fone if you forget your iCloud password.

**Step 1**: Download and install [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

![unlock icloud using drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2**: Click **Screen Unlock** on the main program window. On the next screen, click **Bypass Activate Lock**.

![unlock icloud using drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3**: Click **Start** to initiate the process of unlocking your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without an iCloud password.

![unlock icloud using drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png)

**Note**

Your iPhone will need to be jailbroken before bypassing it using Dr.Fone.

After step 3, there are two possible outcomes for GSM and CDMA iPhone devices.

- If you own a GSM device, the unlocking will do no harm to your iOS device, and you can enjoy your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max as usual.
- If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is CDMA, you won't be able to use the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device for phone calls, cellular data, and iCloud of your new Apple ID.


### Conclusion

Turning on your iCloud's two-factor authentication is necessary for today's high-tech society. It ensures your information is always secure and minimizes the risk of getting hacked or having your account stolen. Once two-factor is active on your Apple ID, Apple provides you with a two-week window to deactivate it if you change your mind.

Meanwhile, if you forgot your iCloud and have a hard time recovering your account, you can try using dedicated programs like Dr.Fone to unlock your iOS device in a few steps.
