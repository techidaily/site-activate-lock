## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13/.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.

If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.

## Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?

If your Apple iPhone 12 Pro is lost or stolen, one of the first steps you should take is to erase the data remotely. This not only protects your personal information but also removes the activation lock.

**Note:** Before proceeding, one should know that once all the data is erased from your Apple iPhone 12 Pro, you will no longer be able to use 'Find my iPhone' and all your data will be erased.

### Steps to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone

1. Launch Find My iPhone on any iOS device and enter your account credentials. You can use any iOS device for this procedure.

    ![find my iphone login](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/icloud-locked-how-to-bypass-icloud-activation-on-iphone-1_637.jpg)

Explore four practical methods to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock on your iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 12 Pro. These solutions help you regain access to your device and its features, enabling you to enjoy your iPad without any restrictions.

### Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner

The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To **bypass iPad 3** activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.

However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device.

**Step 2.** On your iPad, go to the "Settings" application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.

- If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to "iCloud" and sign out.
- If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click "Sign Out."

**Step 3.** It will request the password to your Apple account. Enter it and turn the iPad off. When done, you will not go over the activation lock screen again, and that's how you **bypass iPad 2** activation lock.

### Method 2. Ask the previous owner for the lock removal

If the previous owner failed to do this before selling the iPad to you, this shouldn't cause an issue. But it might be a problem if they have sold you a stolen phone and don't have the remotest clue about the Apple ID.

You don't need to worry about the iPad activation lock if it's a genuine phone. The past user can remotely wipe out the iPad Apple account without having the phone in their control by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Explore the appleid.apple.com site from a web browser and sign in with your Apple ID details.

![find iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-2.jpg)

**Step 3.** Pick your iPad model from the list of devices.

**Step 4.** Then, at that point, click the "Remove from Account" button to get it unlocked. That's how you can perform the **iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 12 Pro iCloud bypass.**

### Method 3. Use DNS Bypass

**Step 1.** When you switch on your device, pick your preferred language and region from the menu.

**Step 2.** Click "Continue" to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect to Wi-Fi, search for the "I" logo near the Wi-Fi tab.

- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23

**Step 6.** Click "Next Page" and tap the "Back" button to enter the iCloud bypass screen.

**Step 7.** You can now set up your applications and utilize your device.

### Method 4. Seek Help from Apple Support

If there are no choices for contacting the past owner of the iPad, you can ask Apple backing to assist you with the **iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 12 Pro iCloud bypass**. That may not be a simple process, but if you have the expected documents (for individuals who got verification of the purchase from the seller), Apple will be willing to help you.

One way to bypass the Find My iPhone activation lock from your iPad without the owner is to introduce proof of purchase to the Apple support group. When you give this to Apple, they can confirm the first owner of the phone and afterward can assist you with the **iPad 2 iCloud bypass**. After confirmation of purchase, they might request different documents, like one of your ID cards.

If you purchased the phone from your family member or somebody who has died, then your other choice to remove the lock is to show their death certificate to Apple. Apple will then, at that point, check the files and could unlock the iPad for you.

In the two cases, it depends on Apple to conclude whether they are happy with your files and if they might want to **bypass iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 12 Pro** lock.
