Have you bought a used iPhone or iPad with an active iCloud Activation Lock? Or perhaps you have an Apple device but cannot remember your iCloud password? Without activating iCloud, you cannot utilize locked devices in either scenario.

If you're selling your Apple iPhone XR or gifting it to someone else, you should first switch off the Find My feature.
