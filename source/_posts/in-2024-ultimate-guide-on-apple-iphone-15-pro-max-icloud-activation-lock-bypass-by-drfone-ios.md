For instance, when Find My iPhone is initiated, you can see where your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is. You might use it to show your location to others or play a sound on your lost device, making it easier to find.

To utilize this feature, you need to initiate this feature on your device and utilize a PC or another phone to find, reset or lock your lost iPhone.

The best way to switch off the Find My feature is very direct. The following steps will tell you how to make it happen:

- Open the Settings of your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and tap your name or profile.
- Explore the "Find My" option and go for "Find My iPhone."

This feature works hand-in-hand with the 'Find My' app. It ensures your data's safety even if your MacBook is lost or stolen. Only the rightful owner can disable **Activation Lock Mac** via their Apple ID. Yet, dealing with this security measure might be challenging for genuine users. This is especially true if they face issues like forgotten passwords or when buying a used device.

### Step 2. Unlocking iOS Devices: GSM and CDMA Activation Differences

Follow the prompt to connect your iOS device with a USB cable. Identify if your device is GSM or CDMA. After bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device, it will work normally. However, for a CDMA device, calling and other cellular functions won't be available. As you continue unlocking the CDMA device, you'll receive step-by-step instructions. Choose the agreement option and click 'Got It!' to move forward.

Afterward, if your Apple device hasn't undergone jailbreaking, the system will prompt the user to proceed with the process. Guidelines for jailbreaking are available in both written and video formats. For iOS/iPadOS versions 16.4 to 16.6, Dr.Fone is designed to perform the jailbreaking process automatically on your device.

Put iOS devices running versions 15.0 to 16.3 into DFU Mode following the on-screen instructions. After initiating DFU Mode for the first time, the program will command the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to restart. Click the right arrow to proceed. Repeat the process to enter DFU Mode for the second time. Upon completion, the program will activate and unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Once finished, select the "Got It!" button to complete the process.

After confirming your jailbroken iOS device, the process initiates automatically to remove the Activation Lock. Upon completion, a message confirming the finished process will be displayed on the screen. While the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is in DFU Mode, the computer screen will show the progress of removing the iCloud **Mac Activation Lock**. Keep an eye on the progress bar until it reaches completion. Click the 'Done' button to finish unlocking the Activation Lock.
