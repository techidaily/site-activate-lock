However, for a CDMA device, calling and other cellular functions won't be available. As you continue unlocking the CDMA device, you'll receive step-by-step instructions. Choose the agreement option and click 'Got It!' to move forward.

Repeat the process to enter DFU Mode for the second time. Upon completion, the program will activate and unlock the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. Once finished, select the "Got It!" button to complete the process.
