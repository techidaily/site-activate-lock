This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods.

The most common question is how to bypass the iCloud activation lock on their iPhones, iPads, or iPod and Apple iPhone XS touches. While you can use several methods to achieve this, we've compiled a list of five of the most effective ones below.

### Method 1. Make the Previous Owner Remove It Remotely
