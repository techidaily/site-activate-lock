## How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max

Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.

In this article, I'm going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.

## Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone
