Apple has placed the Apple iPhone 11 Pro as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special.

If your Apple iPhone 11 Pro gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees.

If you are an IT administrator deploying Microsoft services, you can use Microsoft Intune to get around the Activation Lock easily.

If you are an iPhone 5 to iPhone X user, [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) is available as an option to bypass Activation Lock on the iPhone. It should be noted that this process will cause the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device to be “rooted”, meaning that data services and iCloud will not function and phone calls cannot be made from the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device.
