## 3 Easy Methods to Unlock iCloud Locked Apple iPhone 11/iPad/iPod

## Part 1: Basic information about iCloud lock

### What Does iCloud Lock Mean?

Part of the normal process of setting up a new iPhone is to register the phone with an Apple ID. Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 11 and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to [bypass the iCloud activation](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html) lock.

### What Does This Mean for You?

If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 11 device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 11 device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone 11 is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.

Now that you know everything you need to know about an iCloud-locked iPhone, read on to find out how to unlock an iCloud-locked iPhone.

## Part 4: How to Unlock iCloud-locked iPhone/iPad/iPod for Free?

If you’re the original user of the iPhone, and you think it’s unfair to shell out extra money to unlock an iPhone that should already be unlocked, then you can visit the Apple Store. You may have forgotten your iCloud details, which include your Apple ID or your password. To get your details back, you can visit the Apple Store and follow the steps to retrieve your details. If you bought an iPhone from a seller, endeavor to ask them if it’s a second-hand iPhone and get the right details from the user.

This might seem like an easy solution. However, it is quite difficult and time-consuming. Apple is extremely difficult about its security. As such, you’ll have to be the original owner of the iPhone, and you’ll need to have all your details if you want to be able to carry out this method. You can try to go about this method, but the chances are strong that you’ll give up soon, in which case you should revisit some methods mentioned earlier.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there are a lot of options with which to **unlock iCloud-locked iPhone/iPad/iPod**. There is a quick method, which is temporary. There is a permanent method, which is easy and safe. Finally, there’s also the free method, but that is extremely complicated.

You can feel free to choose the most suitable method for you, but my recommendation is that you use [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) because in that case, a third party takes over the Apple iPhone 11 SE iCloud bypass and all you have to do is wait a while.

### Fix 3. Download New Checkra1n Version

Crucial for a successful jailbreak is carefully selecting the [<u>appropriate Checkra1n version</u>](https://checkra.in/). Compatibility varies across devices, making it essential to choose the version that suits your device. Error 31 issues are likely linked to the specific Checkra1n version in use. In such instances, the recommended solution is to experiment with alternative versions.

### Fix 4. Install iOS Firmware From iTunes and Retry Jailbreaking

When encountering **Checkra1n jailbreak**, error 31 may be attributed to the iOS version on your device. In such cases, the optimal resolution involves reinstalling the iOS version through iTunes. Follow the steps below to personally choose the IPSW file and employ iTunes for the installation on your iOS device:

- **Step 1.** Access the ipsw.me website using a web browser and download the compatible IPSW file for your iOS device. Before installing, ensure that the "Find My" service is disabled.

![disable find my on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-15.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Connect the iOS device to the computer and wait for iTunes/Finder to detect it once all requirements are satisfied. For instance, if you have a Mac with the operating system before macOS Catalina, access the "Summary" tab by clicking the Apple iPhone 11 device icon within iTunes. While holding the "Shift" key on Windows or the "Option" key on Mac, click "Restore iPhone."

- **Step 3.** You will be asked to select the IPSW file. Choose the file you downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. Once complete, re-try the jailbreaking and see if error 31 is resolved.

### Fix 5. Consider Using Other Options in Checkra1n

If the reason behind **Checkra1n error 31** is the Apple iPhone 11 device incompatibility, Checkra1n provides an inbuilt way. When jailbreaking a device, Checkra1n allows you to select the "Untested versions" option. While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 11 device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:

**Instructions.** To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the "Options" and select the "Untested Versions" and "Safe Mode" options. Then, try jailbreaking your device and see if error 31 is resolved.

Remember that this hack includes a specific Checkra1n version and experience that specific user. While you can emulate the experience, the results aren't guaranteed. Here is what that user tried for successful jailbreaking using Checkra1n:

- **Step 1.** Download and install the Checkra1n version 0.10.2 beta on your computer. Now, connect your Apple iPhone 11 to DFU Mode to the system. Initiate the jailbreaking process until the "Right before Trigger" option appears.
