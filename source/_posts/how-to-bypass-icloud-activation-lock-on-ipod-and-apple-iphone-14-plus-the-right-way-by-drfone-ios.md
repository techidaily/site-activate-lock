## Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 14 Plus has an iCloud account lock on it?

If your Apple iPhone 14 Plus has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.

At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as [iCloud Activation Lock](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html). What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device's files, features, and functions.

This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy [a second-hand iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html) from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on.

It doesn't matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 14 Plus. Whether you [jailbreak](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html) it, [reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html) it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.

If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.
