#### How to Jailbreak on Windows and Mac

Jailbreak on Mac and Windows should be the first thing you need to do when you are going to **bypass the Activation Lock**. As we know, many available tools in the market are not compatible with it. You should know what needs to be prepared before you jailbreak on Windows and Mac.

##### [Jailbreak on Windows](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html)

The first thing you need to make sure of is that your computer runs on version 7 or above, and you have a USB flash drive with 2 GB capacity. After that, download the "[checkn1x-amd64.iso](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/checkn1x-amd64.iso)" and "[WinRa1n2.0](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=10620683726822078150)."

##### [Jailbreak on Mac](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-mac.html)

To jailbreak iOS on Mac, download the "[Checkra1n](https://checkra.in/releases/0.12.4-beta#all-downloads)" and then simply try to connect the Mac computer and the iOS device using a USB cable.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Bypass Activation Lock

You are also required to confirm the information, like the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device model.
