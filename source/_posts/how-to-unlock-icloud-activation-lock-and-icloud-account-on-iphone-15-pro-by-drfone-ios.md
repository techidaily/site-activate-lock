## Part 1: Basic knowledge about iCloud activation lock

### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost.

Apple ID and password, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device is still linked to an earlier used account. You should go back to the seller and ask them to give you their password.
