## How to Unlock iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad?

## Part 1: Is it possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone

At the start of 2014, apple introduced what they call "iCloud Activation Lock". This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don't have the credentials using third-party software.

## Part 3: How to Free Unlock the iCloud Lock on iPhone

Since your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is locked, you will not be able to access files until you unlock iCloud on your Apple device. One way to unlock iCloud locked phone is to bypass the iCloud activation lock by following the steps below

Step 1. Take your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and while on the "Activate iPhone" screen, press the home button and then press the "Wi-Fi" settings. Next to the "Wi-Fi" symbol, tap on "i". Now you need to change the existing DNS settings. The DNS settings you need to type are as follows:

1. If you are in the USA type in 104.154.51.7
2. In Europe, type 104.155.28.90
3. In Asia, type 104.155.220.58

## Part 4: How to unlock iCloud lock by Apple iPhone Unlock

Sometimes it may not be possible to completely unlock your iCloud Lock. For instance, the free method of unlocking your iCloud Lock only works on iOS 9 and iOS 8 for iPhones. Anything else will not work properly. Moreover, you may not be able to know how to unlock iCloud lock-free if you are in certain countries. That is when you can think of using the Official iPhone Unlock service which will completely unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max without any hassle. The iCloud Activation Lock Removal tool will quickly remove the iCloud activation lock from the previous owner's account. In short, this is an easy and seamless tool for removing the iCloud lock to set your own.

Step 1 - Visit the [Apple iPhone unlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) by clicking on this link.

Step 3 - Just wait for a confirmation message telling you that the iCloud Lock has been removed.

Step 4 - Now create a new iCloud account and start using your device

This tool works on all iPhone 6, 6+, 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4, and iPad 4, 3, 2 Air 2 and also works on iOS, and it doesn't matter why you are unlocking it from.

### Wrap it up

Unlike the free iCloud Lock unlock solution, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iCloud Activation Lock Removal) tool provides a permanent solution to the problem of how to unlock iCloud locked irrespective of your country. It will only cost you a couple of dollars pounds to unlock your Phone. This is a small price to pay because you might have spent hundreds of dollars to purchase a new iPhone or iPad.

## How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max

Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

In this article, I'm going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.

## Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone

You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max.

#### **Step 1:** Download the Software

Visit the following website [http://en.pangu.io/](http://en.pangu.io/) and click on the "Download and Help" tab. A new page with the download option will open up. The entire download is about 21MB in size. With the file downloaded, install the program on your Mac and launch it. Its interface looks like the screenshot below.

![how to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736110927930.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Connect iDevice

Switch OFF the "Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max" feature and switch ON the "Aeroplane Mode." Connect your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to your Mac using its USB cable and click on the "Start Jailbreak" tab to initiate the jailbreaking process.

#### **Step 3:** Confirmation

A new interface with a screen notification will open up. Carefully read the three steps before proceeding. If you are okay with the information, click on the "Already did" icon. The jailbreaking process will begin from this point.

![start to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736112213161.jpg)

#### **Step 4:** Jailbreak Complete

Your iPhone will reboot a number of times, which is normal. Once the process is done, you will get a "Jailbreak Succeeded" message and the Cydia icon display on your iDevice. Unplug your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and turn ON the "Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max" feature. Set up your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max using your new preferred details.
