## Latest Guide on iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 7 Plus iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

Nowadays, many purchase a used iPhone instead of a fresh, out-of-the-box new one. Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.

It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials. However, we've discovered a few potential ways to **bypass iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 7 Plus**.
