Let's dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

### Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password

The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro and ask for their Apple ID and password. To **bypass Apple iPhone 11 Pro**, you need to have some data in hand:

- Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you're the second owner.

- **Step 3:** Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.
