## How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 13 Pro

Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 13 Pro by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.

In this article, I'm going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 13 Pro from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone 13 Pro"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.

## Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone

You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13 Pro device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13 Pro and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.

## Part 1: 4 Quick Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone 13 Pro iCloud activation lock

### Method 1. Ask the previous owner for Apple ID and passcode

The first thing you can do is to [ask the previous owner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-to-remove-activation-lock-without-previous-owner.html) for their Apple iCloud account credentials. You can use these details to open the account and use it for the **Apple iPhone 13 Pro bypass**.

However, it is the least suggested and least effective method. It is because asking someone about their account details is unethical. The iCloud account has a lot of personal information about the user. Therefore, no one will be willing to hand you the account credentials unless they are your close relatives.

### Method 2. Ask the previous owner to bypass it (iCloud) remotely

The best **Apple iPhone 13 Pro bypass** method is connecting with the past user and having them erase the Apple iPhone 13 Pro from their Apple ID. The previous user can enter their password on the Activation Lock screen or access iCloud. The following are the steps that the past user ought to follow:

- Sign in to iCloud.com and go to Find iPhone.
- Click “All Devices” from the top to open a rundown of the phones connected to their account. It will show all the phones connected to the iCloud account, regardless of whether it's on the web. If this is a family account, it shows every accessory.
- Scroll down until you find the phone you need to eliminate. Click it.
- The site page will show a couple of choices for it. Click "Remove from Account" to disassociate it from iCloud.

### Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

DNS represents the domain name and is a supportive method for bypassing the Apple iPhone 13 Pro activation lock. It controls the DNS server and redirects the authentication way of your phone. It assists you with the Apple iPhone 13 Pro iCloud bypass using these steps:

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-se-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

**Step 1.** Go to the Wi-Fi settings and click Configure IP. Then choose Manual and click "Add Server."

**Step 2.** Click on the "i" and enter the DNS server IP according to your area, which is:

- USA: 104.154.51.7

**Step 3.** Go back and turn on Wi-Fi.
