## Conclusion

From the methods mentioned above, it’s easy to see that it only takes a matter of days to unlock the iCloud account or to completely remove the stubborn iCloud lock. The diversity of both methods allows you to easily pick and use the best method that suits your preferences. Regardless of whether you want to download iCloud remover, or you simply want to go for an easy-to-use and pocket-friendly online platform, the fact remains that both of these methods have got you covered.

The iCloud unlocker download method though effective requires a lot of time to go through it and don’t forget the amount of money used to get it working. On the other hand, what I like about our second method is the fact that it's more efficient and easy to use. With it, I don't have to go through the tiring and complex downloading process, since the company itself bypasses the lock and renders My Apple iPhone XS usable.
