- **Step 5:** Put the Apple iPhone 6s device in DFU mode for the second time. The program will activate the Apple iPhone 6s device when it finishes.
- **Step 6:** Once the Apple iPhone 6s device has been processed under the DFU Mode, the computer’s screen will start displaying the removal of the iCloud Activation Lock. When it’s done, click '**Done**'.

Please note that after the removal of the Activation Lock from the iPhone, it won't be able to make or receive any calls or text messages through cellular networks.


## Part 2: FAQs

### 1\. Why do we need to bypass the iCloud activation lock?

iCloud is software that secures your backups, photos, and passcodes, allows access to Apple's credentials, and much more. iCloud activation lock is one of the features of 'Find Phone' that secures your device's personal information from falling into the wrong hands.

However, it can be trouble if you buy a second-hand iOS device. It can be difficult to access iCloud if the previous one has enabled activation lock. That's why you need to bypass iOS 17, so you can access all the applications and secure all backups.

### 2\. Is it legal to bypass the iCloud activation lock?

Bypassing the iCloud activation lock with or without the previous owner is legal. There are no illegal ways to unlock it. The steps and tools are all legal and safe to bypass the iOS 17 iCloud activation lock. Without bypassing the activation lock, you won't be able to use your iOS device freely or at all.

### 3\. What will happen after a successful bypass?

The data you previously had on your iOS device will be permanently erased as soon as iOS 17 has been bypassed. Additionally, the Apple iPhone 6s device will be set up as a new one. After finishing the bypass, you can now enter all your details and start using the Apple iPhone 6s device. Furthermore, you can back up all your data easily as the previous one has been deleted.
