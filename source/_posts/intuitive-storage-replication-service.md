[What is partition Recovery, and when do I need it?](#collapsetwo)

 Partition recovery is an advanced data recovery process that helps you find lost and deleted drive partitions and scan them for data recovery. You may need to perform partition recovery when your hard drive partitions run into an error and don't appear in File Explorer.

[How does 'Quick Scan' differ from 'Deep Scan'?](#collapsethree)

 'Quick Scan' helps you scan the selected drive faster. This mode is helpful in all data loss or deletion cases on Windows-based storage drives. Whereas 'Deep Scan' does a comprehensive, file signature-based search to maximize data recovery chances in tough data loss such as drive formatting, corruption, etc. Deep Scan is particularly useful when files couldn't be found with 'Quick Scan.'

[Can I run Stellar Data Recovery Professional on a dual monitor setup?](#collapsefour)

 ‘Quick Scan' performs a faster scan on your selected drive or volume. This mode of scan is used in almost all cases of data loss or deletion on Windows-based storage drive.

 Yes. The software comes with an 'Add File-Type' feature that lets you add files even with a unique extension and perform data recovery. Besides this, you can run custom data recovery by choosing a particular type of data from the software's 'Select What to Recover' screen.

[Does Stellar Software recover data from optical drives?](#collapseseven)

 The software can recover data from scratched, corrupted, or partially burnt optical media such as CDs, DVDs, HD DVDs, and Blu-ray discs. It also maintains the recovered files' original file names and folder structure.

[When to select the Physical Disk option?](#collapseeight)

 When you cannot find your system (internal) or removable storage drive in File Explorer, or it appears Unallocated in Disk Management, the drive has turned RAW. You may use the 'Physical Disk' option to locate and recover data from RAW or inaccessible Physical or Removable Disks.
