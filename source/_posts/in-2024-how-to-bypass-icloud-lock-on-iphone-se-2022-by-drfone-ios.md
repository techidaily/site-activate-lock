Nowadays, many purchase a used iPhone instead of a fresh, out-of-the-box new one. Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.
