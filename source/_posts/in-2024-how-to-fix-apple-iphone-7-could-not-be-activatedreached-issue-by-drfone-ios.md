The problem of iCloud Activation Lock is not limited to Mac computers. Apple devices such as iPhones and iPads commonly encounter this situation. If you're locked out of your Apple iPhone 7 and can't recall your Apple ID credentials, there's no cause for concern. Wondershare Dr.Fone provides a robust solution to the iCloud Activation Lock issue. You can follow these steps to bypass the iCloud **Mac Activation Lock**:

### Step 1. Commence Unlocking iCloud Activation Lock Using Wondershare Dr.Fone

Install the most recent edition of Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and open the application. Proceed to the Toolbox section, then select "Screen Unlock."

### Step 2. Unlocking iOS Devices: GSM and CDMA Activation Differences

Follow the prompt to connect your iOS device with a USB cable. Identify if your device is GSM or CDMA. After bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device, it will work normally.

Choose the agreement option and click 'Got It!' to move forward.

Afterward, if your Apple device hasn't undergone jailbreaking, the system will prompt the user to proceed with the process. Guidelines for jailbreaking are available in both written and video formats. For iOS/iPadOS versions 16.4 to 16.6, Dr.Fone is designed to perform the jailbreaking process automatically on your device.

Repeat the process to enter DFU Mode for the second time. Upon completion, the program will activate and unlock the Apple iPhone 7 device. Once finished, select the "Got It!" button to complete the process.
