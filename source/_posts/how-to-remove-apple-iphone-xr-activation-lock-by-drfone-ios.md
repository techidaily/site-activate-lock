## How to Remove Apple iPhone XR Activation Lock

However, the Apple iPhone XR device may already be linked to an iCloud account after it's brought. Therefore, the absence of the correct password makes it impossible to unlock the Apple iPhone XR device.

The new owner needs to contact the original owner to unlock the Apple iPhone XR device. However, if the person has forgotten the password, this issue may cause serious problems. This article will offer insight into **Apple iPhone XR activation lock removal** and the mechanisms necessary to unlock it in the absence or presence of the original owner.

## Part 1: What is Apple iPhone XR Activation Lock? A Quick Look

iPhone activation lock is one of the prominent features of Apple's "Find My iPhone." Once the "Find My iPhone" feature is activated, this feature gets automatically switched on. This activation lock guarantees device data and information safety at all times.

- For devices covered by the AppleCare+ Theft and Loss package, it is crucial to keep the "Find My Device" enabled on the Apple iPhone XR device when it is stolen or lost.
