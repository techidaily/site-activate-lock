![bypass icloud activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/icloud-locked-how-to-bypass-icloud-activation-on-iphone-9_643.jpg)

### How to bypass iCloud activation lock?

#### Step 1: Start the Setup Process

Turn on your Apple iPhone XR and start the setup process until you reach the page where you're asked to connect to a Wi-Fi network.

#### Step 2: Select a Custom DNS Server

When prompted to connect to a Wi-Fi network and input a password, select "i" on your Apple iPhone XR screen, which will take you to a menu with network details. Tap "Configure DNS" and choose "Manual".

Enter a DNS server address based on your geographic location:

- For USA/North America, enter 104.154.51.7
- For Europe, enter 104.155.28.90
- For Asia, enter 104.155.220.58
- For any other area, enter 78.109.17.60

#### Step 3: Proceed with iCloud Bypass

Return to Wi-Fi settings and select your desired network. You might need to enter a password, but instead, you can skip this step and continue. Your Apple iPhone XR will try to activate with these new settings and may allow you to bypass the activation lock.

## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone XR device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone XR device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone XR device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13/.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.

If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.

## Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?

## Part 2: What Are the Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication?

Setting up two-factor authentication is a secure way to protect your device against unauthorized access. Adding another layer to your username and password highly reduces the chances of hackers obtaining your account.

Here are some of the benefits of activating two-factor authentication on your device.

- **Improved security** - A second form of identification aside from your password reduces the chance for someone to gain access to your information.
- **Interconnectivity to mobile engagement** - Two-factor authentication from businesses provides users with a stronger login system to ensure their information is safe in the digital world.
- **Reduces Fraud** - Due to the rise of identity theft in recent years, businesses risk losing trust, brand equity, and credibility. A secure authentication system adds a layer of protection to keep you secure.

## Part 3: How To Set up Two-factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you haven't set up two-factor authentication yet on your iCloud, here are the steps to activate it right now.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone XR/iPad, go to **Settings** and tap your Apple ID profile at the top.

**Step 3**: Enter a phone number to receive the two-factor code via an SMS or a phone call.

**Step 4**: Enter the 6-digit verification code received on your device and wait for the process the finish.

**Note**

To get past two-factor authentication on iCloud, Go to **Settings** > **your name** > **Password & Security**. Tap **Two-Factor Authentication** and turn it **Off** again.

Meanwhile, here are the steps to learn how to bypass 2-step verification on iCloud on the web.

**Step 2**: Click **Sign-In and Security > Account Security**.

![setup icloud 2 factor authentication iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/turn-off-two-factor-authentication-icloud.jpg)

**Step 3**: Click **Turn Off Two-Step Verification.** Answer a security question you've set up previously to finish the process.

## Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you're wondering how to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud, the answer is no, you can't. However, if you don't have access to your trusted device, you can have a code sent to your trusted phone number via an SMS or an automated phone call to prove to Apple that you own the iCloud account.

If this is impossible, you should request [account recovery](https://iforgot.apple.com/) to regain access to your account.

The easiest way to prevent this issue is by adding another phone number to your Apple ID so you'll always have a backup. Here's how.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone XR, go to **Settings** and tap on your **Apple ID** > **Password & Security**.

**Step 2**: Tap **Edit** and choose to **Add a Trusted Phone Number**. You'll have to enter your device's passcode to continue.

![add trusted phone number apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/add-trusted-phone-number-icloud.jpg)

**Step 3**: Enter your new phone number. Select a way to receive a verification code via sms or phone call and tap **Send**.

**Step 4**: Enter the verification code and wait for the process to finish.

## Bonus Tips: Forgot Your iCloud Password? Here's What To Do

Using special programs like [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) can help you recover your iOS device if you forget your iCloud password.

Dr.Fone's key features are:

- Removes all types of iPhone locks such as Apple ID password, Face ID, Touch ID, and more.
- Bypass iCloud activation lock.
- Unlock your Apple iPhone XR without carrier restrictions.
- Remove MDM profile / bypass MDM lock without data loss.


Here's how to use Dr.Fone if you forget your iCloud password.

**Step 1**: Download and install [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

![unlock icloud using drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

![unlock icloud using drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png)

**Note**

Your iPhone will need to be jailbroken before bypassing it using Dr.Fone.

After step 3, there are two possible outcomes for GSM and CDMA iPhone devices.

- If you own a GSM device, the unlocking will do no harm to your iOS device, and you can enjoy your Apple iPhone XR as usual.
- If the Apple iPhone XR is CDMA, you won't be able to use the Apple iPhone XR device for phone calls, cellular data, and iCloud of your new Apple ID.


### Conclusion

Turning on your iCloud's two-factor authentication is necessary for today's high-tech society. It ensures your information is always secure and minimizes the risk of getting hacked or having your account stolen. Once two-factor is active on your Apple ID, Apple provides you with a two-week window to deactivate it if you change your mind.

Meanwhile, if you forgot your iCloud and have a hard time recovering your account, you can try using dedicated programs like Dr.Fone to unlock your iOS device in a few steps.
