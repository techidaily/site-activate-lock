### Conclusion

Turning on your iCloud's two-factor authentication is necessary for today's high-tech society. It ensures your information is always secure and minimizes the risk of getting hacked or having your account stolen. Once two-factor is active on your Apple ID, Apple provides you with a two-week window to deactivate it if you change your mind.

Meanwhile, if you forgot your iCloud and have a hard time recovering your account, you can try using dedicated programs like Dr.Fone to unlock your iOS device in a few steps.
