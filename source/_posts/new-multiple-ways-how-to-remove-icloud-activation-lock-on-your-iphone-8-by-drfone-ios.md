Undeniably, one of Apple’s selling points is its focus on security. iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple stuff all enjoy this robust security system. Of course, this is mainly made by Apple through iCloud or Apple ID. This system is designed to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access. This is what makes Apple’s devices highly secure and sought after.

However, a common challenge arises when you acquire a second-hand iPhone or iPad. You may find it’s connected to the previous owner’s iCloud account through an Activation Lock. This situation can be a significant hurdle, rendering the Apple iPhone 8 device almost unusable. As you may expect, this article will help you **remove the iCloud Activation Lock**.

![activation lock page ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 8 device to a specific Apple ID.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.

## Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password

If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 8 device, learning **how to remove iCloud Activation Lock** is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.

If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 8 device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 8 device. If the Apple iPhone 8 device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to **Settings >** Tap on the profile on top of the app > **Sign Out**.

![icloud sign out button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-02.jpg)

If you’ve forgotten your Apple ID, it can be recovered by signing in with your Apple ID account. Then, click the **Forgot Password** button. You may need to answer security questions or receive a code on a trusted device to complete this process.

### Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)

Alternatively, you can remove the iCloud account by following the steps below. You can ask the original owner to do this or do it independently if you can access the account.

- **Step 1:** Go to <www.iCloud.com/find> on any web browser.
- **Step 2:** Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 8 device owner’s ID) and password.

- **Step 3:** From the list of devices associated with this Apple ID, select the one you wish to unlock.
- **Step 4:** Click **Remove from Account**. This action will disassociate the Apple iPhone 8 device from the Apple ID, removing the Activation Lock.

Following these steps, you can **remove the iCloud Activation Lock** from your device, provided you can access the necessary Apple ID credentials. This method is the most secure and straightforward way to regain access to your device without compromising your data or the Apple iPhone 8 device’s functionality.

## Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you're wondering how to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud, the answer is no, you can't.
