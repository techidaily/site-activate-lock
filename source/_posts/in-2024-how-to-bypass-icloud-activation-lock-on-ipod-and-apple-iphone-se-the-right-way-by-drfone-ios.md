## Part 1: Is It Possible to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on iPod and Apple iPhone SE By Myself?

Yes, iPod and Apple iPhone SE touch activation lock bypass can be done by yourself. However, it is not an easy process and requires some technical knowledge.

iCloud activation lock is a security feature that Apple introduced in iOS 7. It prevents anyone from using an iPhone, iPad, or iPod and Apple iPhone SE touch if it is stolen or lost. If you have an iOS device with an iCloud activation lock, you must enter the correct Apple ID and password to use it.

There are a few ways to bypass the iCloud activation lock, but they all require technical expertise. If you're not comfortable with technical things, you may want to consider taking your device to a professional. Alternatively, you can try following the instructions in one of the methods below.

## Part 2: 5 Easy Methods to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on iPod and Apple iPhone SE

The most common question is how to bypass the iCloud activation lock on their iPhones, iPads, or iPod and Apple iPhone SE touches. While you can use several methods to achieve this, we've compiled a list of five of the most effective ones below.

### Method 1. Make the Previous Owner Remove It Remotely

If you have a personal relationship with the previous owner of the iOS device, you might be able to ask them to help you remove the Find My iPhone Activation Lock remotely using iCloud.com:

**Step 1.** Sign in to iCloud using your Apple ID and password by going to the official website.

**Step 2.** You can select the associated device by clicking All Devices at the top of the screen.

**Step 3.** You can erase the Apple iPhone SE device by clicking "Erase \[device\]".

![remove activation lock on ipod](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/bypass-ipod-activation-lock-2.png)

In this step, the previous owner's iCloud account has been completely removed from the Apple iPhone SE device, and the Activation Lock has also been removed.

### Method 2. Get the Previous Owner's Apple ID and Password

If you have an iPod and Apple iPhone SE locked by iCloud, you'll need the previous owner's Apple ID and password to bypass the activation lock and use the Apple iPhone SE device. iCloud activation locks are put in place to protect your device and data, but if you've purchased a used iPod and Apple iPhone SE from someone who didn't remove their account information, you'll be stuck with a locked device.

### Method 3. DNS Bypass

- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Africa, Australia, and other locations: 78.109.17.60

**Step 6:** After tapping "Save", click on the back option and select "Ask to Join Networks".

**Step 7:** Enter the network password and then tap "Join".

**Step 8:** To set up the Apple iPhone SE device normally, tap on the back button when it tries to activate.

## How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone SE

Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone SE by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone SE.

In this article, I'm going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone SE from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone SE"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.

## Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone

You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone SE device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone SE and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone SE.

#### **Step 1:** Download the Software

Visit the following website [http://en.pangu.io/](http://en.pangu.io/) and click on the "Download and Help" tab. A new page with the download option will open up. The entire download is about 21MB in size. With the file downloaded, install the program on your Mac and launch it. Its interface looks like the screenshot below.
