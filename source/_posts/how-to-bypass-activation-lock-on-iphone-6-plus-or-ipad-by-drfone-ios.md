## How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad?

Apple has long been famous for providing sound devices, with nifty safety and user-friendly features. With that said, if you just purchased a used iOS device, you may be required to bypass the activation lock on your device using iCloud, or the previous user’s account. Before we take a look at how to bypass an activation lock on an Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad, let’s examine what an activation lock on an Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad entails.

![bypass activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/bypass-activation-lock.jpg)

## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad?

This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery. Without access to the owner’s Apple ID and/or password, accessing the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device becomes impossible. Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.

This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 6 Plus option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 6 Plus. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.

## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

Using a valid Apple ID and password is the easiest way to bypass the activation lock on Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad Mini. In any case, if you legitimately purchased the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device from the previous owner, they should have no qualms giving you these details. If it’s a new device, and you are the original owner, you will have this information ready to use for activation. Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad Mini.

![add apple id password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/add-apple-id-password.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Within a few minutes, the home screen should appear on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad.

- **Step 5.** Chances are, the Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad will prompt you to enter the original user’s ID and Password. Simply enter the details available to you.
- **Step 6.** Finally, the best part of the unlocking process; navigate to the settings tab to erase all data. Open up settings, click reset and proceed to erase all content, including settings.

## Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 6 Plus has an iCloud account lock on it?

If your Apple iPhone 6 Plus has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.

At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as [iCloud Activation Lock](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html). What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device's files, features, and functions.

This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy [a second-hand iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html) from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.

It doesn't matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 6 Plus. Whether you [jailbreak](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html) it, [reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html) it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 6 Plus.

If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.
