## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone SE (2020) or iPad?

This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery.

It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone SE (2020). Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone SE (2020) or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.
