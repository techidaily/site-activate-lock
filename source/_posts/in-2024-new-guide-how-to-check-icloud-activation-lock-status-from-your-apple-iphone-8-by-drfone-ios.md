![iphone lockscreen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg)

****Note:**** **If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone 8 device still needs to be fully erased. In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone 8 device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.**

- **Step 2:** Start setting up the Apple iPhone 8 device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone 8 device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.
- **Step 3:** During the setup, if the Apple iPhone 8 device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone 8 device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone 8 device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.

If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an **activation lock check** when buying second-hand phones.

## Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices
