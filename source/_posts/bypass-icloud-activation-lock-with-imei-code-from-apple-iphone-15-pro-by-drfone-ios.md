## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![check IMEI code on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg)

**Method 2:** Click the "Device" icon in iTunes to access the "Summary" tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, tap "Phone Number" under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device model.

![look for imei on itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg)

**Method 3:** For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you're on the “General” tab, then select "Phone Number" below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

### 3\. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone

For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.

## Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?

## 3 Effective Ways to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro

Ever since the launch of the first iPhone, both iPhone and Apple have seen tremendous growth year after year on account of the new features and capabilities Apple continues to add to the iPhone. Apple has placed the Apple iPhone 15 Pro as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.

Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro. We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.

## Part 1: Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.

## Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 15 Pro)

An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone but forgot to erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device before submitting and consequently, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that Apple iPhone 15 Pro to make it useable again. There are a few ways you can go about it.

### Method 1. Bypassing Activation Lock Using Apple ID

- Step 1: Enter device Recovery Mode and Restore the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device to factory settings.
- Step 2: When you set up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device again, you will be required to sign in to the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. Do that and you are golden!

### Method 2. Bypassing Activation Lock from iCloud Website

You may also do away with Activation Lock using the Find My iPhone app in iCloud remotely by erasing the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device and removing the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device from the associated iCloud account.

- Step 1: Visit the iCloud website on a computer at <https://icloud.com>.
- Step 2: Sign In and go to Find iPhone.

![erase iphone and bypass activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-13-3.jpg)

This process requires that the data service be functional on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro in question, otherwise, this will not work. When the process is done, restart the Apple iPhone 15 Pro and set it up with your Apple ID to remove the lock.

### Method 3. Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune

If you are an IT administrator and are using Microsoft services, you may have given employees iPhones. When employees leave or are made to leave, it is possible that the Apple iPhone 15 Pro devices they leave behind are still signed in with a password only they know. There is a way Apple provides for Microsoft Intune to disable Activation Lock for corporate devices.

![what is microsoft intune](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/what-is-intune.png)

- Step 1: Sign in to the admin center on Microsoft Endpoint Manager.
- Step 2: Select Devices under Intune.
- Step 3: Select All Devices.
- Step 4: Locate the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device you want to disable the lock for, and under the Hardware section, copy the Activation Lock Bypass Code given under Conditional Access.
- Step 5: Under the Overview pane of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device, select Wipe.
- Step 6: When the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device resets, it prompts for the Apple ID and password. Leave the ID blank and enter the bypass code as a password.

Anything else will not work properly. Moreover, you may not be able to know how to unlock iCloud lock-free if you are in certain countries. That is when you can think of using the Official iPhone Unlock service which will completely unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro without any hassle. The iCloud Activation Lock Removal tool will quickly remove the iCloud activation lock from the previous owner's account. In short, this is an easy and seamless tool for removing the iCloud lock to set your own.

Step 1 - Visit the [Apple iPhone unlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) by clicking on this link.

Step 2 - Enter the IMEI/Serial number of your device and send it.

Step 3 - Just wait for a confirmation message telling you that the iCloud Lock has been removed.

Step 4 - Now create a new iCloud account and start using your device

This tool works on all iPhone 6, 6+, 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4, and iPad 4, 3, 2 Air 2 and also works on iOS, and it doesn't matter why you are unlocking it from.

### Wrap it up

Unlike the free iCloud Lock unlock solution, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iCloud Activation Lock Removal) tool provides a permanent solution to the problem of how to unlock iCloud locked irrespective of your country. It will only cost you a couple of dollars pounds to unlock your Phone. This is a small price to pay because you might have spent hundreds of dollars to purchase a new iPhone or iPad.
