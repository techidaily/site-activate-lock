Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.

It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials.
