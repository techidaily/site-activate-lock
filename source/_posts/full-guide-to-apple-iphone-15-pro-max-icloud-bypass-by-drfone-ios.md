Since your iPad and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is locked, you cannot access anything until you unlock your Apple device. One method for unlocking an iCloud-locked device is to use the DNS bypass by following the steps underneath:

**Step 1.** Take your iPad, and remember that on the “Activate iPhone” screen, press the home button and afterward press the "Wi-Fi" settings. Close to the Wi-Fi image, tap on the “I” symbol. Now you need to change the current DNS settings of your iPad. The DNS settings you want to type are as per the following:

- For users in the USA, type in 104.154.51.7
- In Europe, type 104.155.28.90
- In Asia, type 104.155.220.58
- For other parts of the world, key in 78.109.17.60

**Step 2.** Click the “Back” button, then Done. Then, click the “Activation help” option. You will see a message saying you have connected to my server whenever you do that. You will get to various iCloud services if you tap on the menu. Furthermore, you can access the User's Chat, Mail, Social, Video, YouTube, and other things from there.
