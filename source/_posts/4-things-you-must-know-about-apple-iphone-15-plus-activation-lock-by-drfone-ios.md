It’s a way to ensure that only the rightful owner can use and access the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. Originally designed as a theft deterrent, the iCloud Activation Lock on used Apple Devices becomes especially important when buying or selling second-hand phones.

Understanding the status of this lock is essential to ensure a secure and legitimate transaction. In this 2024 guide, you’ll dive into how to **check the iCloud Activation Lock status**. It’s a critical step for anyone involved in the trade of used Apple devices online or otherwise.

![iphone activation lock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-01.jpg)

## Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device

Understanding the iCloud Activation Lock is essential when purchasing a used Apple device. This security feature, designed by Apple, is activated when ‘Find My iPhone’ is enabled. It links the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to the owner’s Apple ID, preventing others from activating it without the owner’s permission. This lock is crucial for preventing unauthorized use of lost or stolen devices.

Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, **checking the iCloud Activation Lock status** is important. Here’s how:

- **Step 1:** Power on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has been properly erased.

![iphone lockscreen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg)

****Note:**** **If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device still needs to be fully erased. In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.**

- **Step 2:** Start setting up the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.
- **Step 3:** During the setup, if the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.

If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an **activation lock check** when buying second-hand phones.

## Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices

If you’re planning to sell your Apple iPhone 15 Plus or are curious about the status of a lost phone, you should also perform an **iCloud lock check**. This feature, crucial for security, can prevent a new user from accessing the phone without your permission. Here’s how you can check the status:

### Method 1: Check Within the Phone

The first way to check your devices’ iCloud activation lock status is through the Apple iPhone 15 Plus devices themselves. There are two ways to do this, as presented in this section.

#### Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App

First, open Settings on your iDevice. At the top of its menu, tap on your profile name.

If you see an iCloud account listed here and you’re signed in, your device is still linked to that iCloud account. Thus, it will still be under the iCloud Activation Lock. If there is no iCloud activation lock, it should look like this:

![iphone no icloud lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-03.jpg)

#### Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation

If you are setting up the phone afresh or after a factory reset, proceed with the initial setup steps. Suppose the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device asks for an Apple ID and password previously associated with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device at any point during the setup. In that case, it indicates that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active. This occurs if the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device was not correctly erased before the reset.

### Method 2: Using IMEI Number

Every iPhone or iPad has its own IMEI number. It can be used to check details about the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device remotely, including **checking the iCloud Activation Lock**. Here are the steps to use your IMEI number to **check the iCloud Activation Lock status** of your phone using third-party apps:

- **Step 1:** Open your **Settings** app on the iDevice.
- **Step 2:** Go to **General**, then choose **About.**
- **Step 3:** Find the **IMEI** number by scrolling down. It’s a 15-digit number that’s unique to your device.

![imei page iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-04.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Several third-party websites offer services to check iCloud Activation Lock status using the IMEI number. Some of these services are free, while others might charge a small fee. Make sure to use a reputable service to avoid scams.
- **Step 5:** On the chosen service’s website, enter your device’s IMEI number.
- **Step 6:** The service will provide details regarding the iCloud activation lock status.

Remember, if selling, always erase your device and sign out of iCloud to remove the activation lock. For buyers, always ensure your device is free from previous iCloud accounts.

## Part 4. Is it possible to remove the activation lock if it's a secondhand iPhone?

Normally, it is up to the previous user with his Apple ID to provide you with the appropriate credentials to remove the activation lock across the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. For such cases, you need to contact the user himself and explain the reasons for coming up with such a situation. One easy way of confirming the credentials is by going to the locality of the user himself. With this, the phone is just a restart away, followed by the standard activation procedures that would help you remove the Activation Lock across your device.

It isn't easy to follow these steps if you do not own the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and can't contact the owner. Under such circumstances, you have to use a third-party program. [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) is one of the best programs to remove an iCloud activation lock.

## Conclusion

The article has explained a very comprehensive set of features and tools that can be efficiently consumed to remove the Activation Lock across an iPhone for removing the Find My iPhone settings. The mechanisms stated can provide you with the appropriate execution if followed properly. For this, you need to follow the guide to understand all the dynamics involved in the system.
