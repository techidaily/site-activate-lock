### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost. Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max should be iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6S, or 6S + to have the services of the iCloud activation lock. For phones on iOS 7 and above versions, the activation lock is auto-enabled once the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is switched on.

### What is the iCloud activation lock used for?

An iCloud lock is basically for the security of an individual’s phone to not misuse and your details are safe. Once the 'Find My iPhone’ feature is enabled on your Apple devices, Apple’s activation server saves your Apple Id. Henceforth whenever your phone is turned off or performs any type of action such as erasing the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device or reactivating the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, then your device will ask for unlocking iCloud activation.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max was iCloud activation locked?

If you are purchasing an iPhone or any other Apple device from someone, you need to make sure that the Apple device is no longer linked to the prior owner's account. To make sure you are on the safe side, you could check it for yourself. There are two ways to check:

2\. Follow the steps below to be sure that you can use your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device hassle-free:

1) Switch on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device and slide to unlock it.

The seller will go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Ensure the seller clears the phone before he hands it over to you for use.

Once you have selected the language, country, and connected to a network, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device will start activation. If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device prompts you for the previous owner’s

Apple ID and password, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device is still linked to an earlier used account. You should go back to the seller and ask them to give you their password.
