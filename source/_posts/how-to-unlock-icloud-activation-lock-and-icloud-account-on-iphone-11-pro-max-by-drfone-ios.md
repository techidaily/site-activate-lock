## Part 1: Basic knowledge about iCloud activation lock

### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost. Your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max should be iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6S, or 6S + to have the services of the iCloud activation lock. For phones on iOS 7 and above versions, the activation lock is auto-enabled once the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is switched on.

Henceforth whenever your phone is turned off or performs any type of action such as erasing the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device or reactivating the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device, then your device will ask for unlocking iCloud activation.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max was iCloud activation locked?

If you are purchasing an iPhone or any other Apple device from someone, you need to make sure that the Apple device is no longer linked to the prior owner's account. To make sure you are on the safe side, you could check it for yourself. There are two ways to check:

1\. You can visit [https://icloud.com/activationlock](https://icloud.com/activationlock) from any Computer or MAC to check the present Activation Lock status of the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device.
