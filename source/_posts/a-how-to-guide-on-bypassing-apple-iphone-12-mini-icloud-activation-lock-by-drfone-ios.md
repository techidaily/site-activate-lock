The best **Apple iPhone 12 mini bypass** method is connecting with the past user and having them erase the Apple iPhone 12 mini from their Apple ID. The previous user can enter their password on the Activation Lock screen or access iCloud. The following are the steps that the past user ought to follow:

- Sign in to iCloud.com and go to Find iPhone.
- Click “All Devices” from the top to open a rundown of the phones connected to their account. It will show all the phones connected to the iCloud account, regardless of whether it's on the web. If this is a family account, it shows every accessory.
- Scroll down until you find the phone you need to eliminate. Click it.
- The site page will show a couple of choices for it. Click "Remove from Account" to disassociate it from iCloud.

### Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass
