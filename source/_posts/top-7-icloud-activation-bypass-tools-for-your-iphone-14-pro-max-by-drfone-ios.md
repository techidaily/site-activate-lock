The iCloud DNS Bypass can assist you if you forget your login information (Apple ID or password) or purchase a used device with an iCloud lock activated. It is a free approach to unlocking iCloud.

The readable names are transformed into numerical IP addresses via the Domain Name System (DNS). To launch the program, it makes use of a DNS server that serves as a host.
