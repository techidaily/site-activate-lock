## Part 2: 3 Ways to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on iPhone/iPad with iOS 16

Now you know how an iCloud Activation Lock works and how to remotely lock your phone in case of theft. However, what if you still want to be able the bypass the iCloud Activation Lock but are unable to contact the first owner for their credentials? There are multiple ways that you can do that, and we will share the ways with you below:

### Method 1: Removing the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device from the First Owner's iCloud

Probably one of the easiest and fastest ways to bypass the activation lock is by contacting the owner to remove the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device that you have from their iCloud. If you can still make contact with them, you can try this option and reach out to them.

### Method 2: Contact Apple to Remove The Activation Lock

If you cannot contact the previous owner, you can then [reach out to Apple directly](https://al-support.apple.com/#/kbase) and provide proof that you have inherited or purchased the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device. Documents such as receipts and death certificates if inherited, then you can reach out to their support team to unlock your device.
