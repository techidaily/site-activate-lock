## Part 1: What Is Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

Not to be confused with Apple's two-step authentication, the new and more secure two-factor authentication on iCloud introduces push notifications on your iOS device to keep your data safe. With Apple's two unique ways to prove your identity, hackers will find it harder to access your personal and financial data.

Switching to two-factor authentication rather than two-step is becoming more common nowadays as security measures are more advanced. You can always switch your security measure at any point, but remember that two-factor authentication is now an essential way to keep your data safe.

![icloud 2 factor authentication and apple id verification](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/icloud-two-factor-authentication-notification.jpg)

## Part 2: What Are the Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication?

Setting up two-factor authentication is a secure way to protect your device against unauthorized access. Adding another layer to your username and password highly reduces the chances of hackers obtaining your account.

Here are some of the benefits of activating two-factor authentication on your device.

- **Improved security** - A second form of identification aside from your password reduces the chance for someone to gain access to your information.
- **Interconnectivity to mobile engagement** - Two-factor authentication from businesses provides users with a stronger login system to ensure their information is safe in the digital world.
- **Reduces Fraud** - Due to the rise of identity theft in recent years, businesses risk losing trust, brand equity, and credibility. A secure authentication system adds a layer of protection to keep you secure.

## Part 3: How To Set up Two-factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you haven't set up two-factor authentication yet on your iCloud, here are the steps to activate it right now.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro/iPad, go to **Settings** and tap your Apple ID profile at the top.

![setup icloud 2 factor authentication iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/setup-icloud-two-factor-authentication.jpg)

## Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you're wondering how to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud, the answer is no, you can't. However, if you don't have access to your trusted device, you can have a code sent to your trusted phone number via an SMS or an automated phone call to prove to Apple that you own the iCloud account.

If this is impossible, you should request [account recovery](https://iforgot.apple.com/) to regain access to your account.

The easiest way to prevent this issue is by adding another phone number to your Apple ID so you'll always have a backup. Here's how.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, go to **Settings** and tap on your **Apple ID** > **Password & Security**.

**Step 2**: Tap **Edit** and choose to **Add a Trusted Phone Number**. You'll have to enter your device's passcode to continue.
