It links the phone to their Apple IDs and keeps any other individual from getting to the phone without entering the password. While this is useful, it can likewise create some issues. If you recover your Apple iPhone 13 passcode but fail to remember your Apple ID, you're in a bad situation.

### Can hackers bypass iCloud lock?

To do so, they phish the Apple iPhone 13 user or trick employees at Apple Stores, which can nullify iCloud locks. Cheats, coders, and programmers participate in an underground industry that eliminates an iCloud account from an Apple iPhone 13 to re-sell them.

### Conclusion
