## Part 1: 4 Efficient Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone XR iCloud Activation Lock

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner

For an **Apple iPhone XR iCloud bypass**, you'll require a couple of significant pieces of data:

- Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone XR device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.
- If a device doesn't have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone XR passcode in mind.

![owners apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone XR iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone XR.

With the Apple iPhone XR device completely set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.

### 2\. Use DNS Bypass

Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses.

- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
