If you have an iOS device with an iCloud activation lock, you must enter the correct Apple ID and password to use it.

There are a few ways to bypass the iCloud activation lock, but they all require technical expertise. If you're not comfortable with technical things, you may want to consider taking your device to a professional. Alternatively, you can try following the instructions in one of the methods below.

## Part 2: 5 Easy Methods to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on iPod and Apple iPhone 13

The most common question is how to bypass the iCloud activation lock on their iPhones, iPads, or iPod and Apple iPhone 13 touches. While you can use several methods to achieve this, we've compiled a list of five of the most effective ones below.

## How To Bypass iCloud By Checkra1n Even On Apple iPhone 13 If You've Tried Everything

Since iOS 12.3, Apple has been using its new Activation Lock feature to deter theft. This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.

**Pros**
