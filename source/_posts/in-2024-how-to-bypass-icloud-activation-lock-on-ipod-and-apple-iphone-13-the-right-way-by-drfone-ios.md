The most common question is how to bypass the iCloud activation lock on their iPhones, iPads, or iPod and Apple iPhone 13 touches. While you can use several methods to achieve this, we've compiled a list of five of the most effective ones below.

### Method 1. Make the Previous Owner Remove It Remotely

If you have a personal relationship with the previous owner of the iOS device, you might be able to ask them to help you remove the Find My iPhone Activation Lock remotely using iCloud.com:

## How To Bypass iCloud By Checkra1n Even On Apple iPhone 13 If You've Tried Everything

Since iOS 12.3, Apple has been using its new Activation Lock feature to deter theft. This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.
