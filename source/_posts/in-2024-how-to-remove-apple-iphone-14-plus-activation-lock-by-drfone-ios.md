## How to Remove Apple iPhone 14 Plus Activation Lock

It is always better to purchase a second-hand iDevice over a brand-new one. A second-hand iPhone or iPad may seem appealing to people on a tight budget. However, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device may already be linked to an iCloud account after it's brought. Therefore, the absence of the correct password makes it impossible to unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.

The new owner needs to contact the original owner to unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. However, if the person has forgotten the password, this issue may cause serious problems. This article will offer insight into **Apple iPhone 14 Plus activation lock removal** and the mechanisms necessary to unlock it in the absence or presence of the original owner.

## Part 1: What is Apple iPhone 14 Plus Activation Lock? A Quick Look

iPhone activation lock is one of the prominent features of Apple's "Find My iPhone." Once the "Find My iPhone" feature is activated, this feature gets automatically switched on. This activation lock guarantees device data and information safety at all times.

It also restrains anyone from reactivating the stolen device, even after erasing it. Below are some of the significant benefits of turning on the apple activation lock.

- For devices covered by the AppleCare+ Theft and Loss package, it is crucial to keep the "Find My Device" enabled on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device when it is stolen or lost.
- It allows iPhone users to track the physical location of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. This may be done by playing a sound on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. The user may also activate the Lost Mode via Find My iPhone.

The user may also reset the Apple iPhone 14 Plus password via iCloud when the **activation lock** feature is turned on.
