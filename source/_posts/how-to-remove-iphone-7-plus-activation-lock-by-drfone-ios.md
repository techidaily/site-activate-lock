## Part 3: How To Bypass iCloud Lock on Apple iPhone 7 Plus via the DNS Change Method

Apart from using a paid service to bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 7 Plus, you can employ a simple free-to-use unlocking method. One such method is the DNS change process. With this approach, you don’t need to use any paid service, and neither do you have to wait for days for the lock to be bypassed.

Here’s how you can unlock and bypass the iCloud Activation Lock by using the DNS change method.

1: On your iCloud Activation interface, press the “Home” button and select the “WiFi” settings option.

2: On your WiFi settings, tap on the circled “I” icon. This action will open the DNS settings.

To those located in the USA/North America, enter 104.154.51.7. To those located in Europe, enter 104.155.28.90. To those in Asia and the rest of the world, enter 104.155.220.58 and 78.109.17.60 respectively.

4: Once you have entered the DNS digits, tap “Back” and finally tap on the “Done” option.

5: To temporarily bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 7 Plus, tap on the “Activation Help” option. You will get a display message that reads “You have successfully connected to my server”.

6: Now tap on the “Menu” option. You will now be in a position to access features such as videos, games, iCloud Locked User Chats, and the internet.

The iCloud Activation Lock is no doubt a makeshift game-changer in the iOS platform. However, as robust and secure as it remains to be, it is no secret that this security feature can be bypassed if the right methods on how to bypass iCloud lock are employed. As seen in this article, regardless of whether you want to bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 7 Plus by using the DNS change option, the Official iPhoneUnlock, or the iPhoneIMEI.net method, the fact remains that it is up to you to choose the preferred method to bypass iCloud lock when the need arises.
