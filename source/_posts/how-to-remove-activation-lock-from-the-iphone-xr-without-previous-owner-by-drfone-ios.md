## Part 1: 4 Quick Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone XR iCloud activation lock

### Method 1. Ask the previous owner for Apple ID and passcode

The first thing you can do is to [ask the previous owner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-to-remove-activation-lock-without-previous-owner.html) for their Apple iCloud account credentials. You can use these details to open the account and use it for the **Apple iPhone XR bypass**.

However, it is the least suggested and least effective method. It is because asking someone about their account details is unethical. The iCloud account has a lot of personal information about the user. Therefore, no one will be willing to hand you the account credentials unless they are your close relatives.

### Method 2. Ask the previous owner to bypass it (iCloud) remotely

The best **Apple iPhone XR bypass** method is connecting with the past user and having them erase the Apple iPhone XR from their Apple ID. The previous user can enter their password on the Activation Lock screen or access iCloud. The following are the steps that the past user ought to follow:

- Sign in to iCloud.com and go to Find iPhone.
- Click “All Devices” from the top to open a rundown of the phones connected to their account. It will show all the phones connected to the iCloud account, regardless of whether it's on the web. If this is a family account, it shows every accessory.
- Scroll down until you find the phone you need to eliminate. Click it.
- The site page will show a couple of choices for it. Click "Remove from Account" to disassociate it from iCloud.

### Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

DNS represents the domain name and is a supportive method for bypassing the Apple iPhone XR activation lock. It controls the DNS server and redirects the authentication way of your phone. It assists you with the Apple iPhone XR iCloud bypass using these steps:

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-se-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

**Step 1.** Go to the Wi-Fi settings and click Configure IP. Then choose Manual and click "Add Server."

**Step 2.** Click on the "i" and enter the DNS server IP according to your area, which is:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
