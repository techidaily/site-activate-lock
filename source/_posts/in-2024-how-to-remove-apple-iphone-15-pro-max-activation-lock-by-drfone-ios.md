## Part 1: What Is iCloud Activation Lock? And How Does It Work?

Apple's iCloud Activation Lock feature is designed to prevent anyone from using your iOS device if your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad, or iPod Touch gets lost or stolen. This feature automatically turns on when you activate **Find My** on your device.

Even as you erase your information remotely, iCloud Activation Lock improves your chances of recovering your lost iOS device by keeping your Find My turned on. This feature deters anyone from reactivating your device without your permission.
