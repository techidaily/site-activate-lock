Step 3 - Just wait for a confirmation message telling you that the iCloud Lock has been removed.

Step 4 - Now create a new iCloud account and start using your device

This tool works on all iPhone 6, 6+, 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4, and iPad 4, 3, 2 Air 2 and also works on iOS, and it doesn't matter why you are unlocking it from.

### Wrap it up

Unlike the free iCloud Lock unlock solution, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iCloud Activation Lock Removal) tool provides a permanent solution to the problem of how to unlock iCloud locked irrespective of your country. It will only cost you a couple of dollars pounds to unlock your Phone. This is a small price to pay because you might have spent hundreds of dollars to purchase a new iPhone or iPad.
