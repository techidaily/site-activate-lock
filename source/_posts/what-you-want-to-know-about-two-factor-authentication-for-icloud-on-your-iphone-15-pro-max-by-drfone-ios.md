## How To Bypass iCloud By Checkra1n Even On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max If You've Tried Everything

Since iOS 12.3, Apple has been using its new Activation Lock feature to deter theft. This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.

While this is a welcomed addition for those looking to protect their device, it can also be a major inconvenience for those who have lost or forgotten their iCloud password. Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information. You will learn in this post how to use Checkra1n iCloud bypass to unlock your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: What is Checkra1n?

Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.

Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don't know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.

Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don't know the passcode.

**Pros**

- The tool doesn't require tech skills
- It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices
- Supports a wide range of hardware platforms
- It is not possible to exploit remotely

**Cons**

- Jailbreaking older devices is limited
- A reboot won't save them

## Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?

You may consider using Checkra1n if you are looking for a method to bypass the iCloud activation lock. You can remove the iCloud activation lock from your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad using this method.

### 1\. How to Jailbreak an iOS Device with Checkra1n?

**Step 1:** Enter the BIOS settings after the computer has rebooted.

**Step 2:** Go to Boot Menu and select the jailbreak USB drive you just created.

![ios 15 icloud bypass frpfile](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/checkra1n-icloud-bypass-1.png)

**Step 3:** Plug your iOS device into the PC and click \[Start\].

![checkra1n icloud bypass download](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/checkra1n-icloud-bypass-2.png)

**Step 4:** The software may inform you that your iOS version is not tested. Follow the steps below to enable the Start key on the iOS device at risk if you are ready to jailbreak.

Follow these steps to enable the \[Start\] key:

- Select \[Options\].
- Ensure that Untested iOS, iPadOS, and TVOS versions are checked.
- To return to the homepage, click \[Back\].
- To begin the jailbreaking process, click \[Start\].

**Step 5:** You will be shown how to enter DFU mode on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Follow the instructions step by step.

![checkra1n icloud bypass windows download](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/checkra1n-icloud-bypass-3.png)

**Step 6:** You have successfully jailbroken your device.

![checkra1n icloud bypass ios 15](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/checkra1n-icloud-bypass-4.png)

Since Cocosenor bypass Tuner now uses checkra1n 0.12.2 to help jailbreak, it won't be able to jailbreak iOS 14.5.

### 2\. How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?

The next step is to figure out how to bypass iCloud with Checkra1n iCloud Bypass. We will show you how to use the method on a Mac. The Checkra1n installation process has a few technical aspects, but if you follow the steps, you shouldn't have any problem.

**Step 1.** Download Checkra1n from the official website.

**Step 2.** Using the Terminal app, install brew and usbmuxd by entering the following commands:

- /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install…>)"
- brew install usbmuxd

**Step 3.** Launch Checkra1n once those have been installed.

**Step 4.** Follow the instructions to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max by connecting it to your computer.

**Step 5.** The following command will create a tunnel from Port 2222 to Port 44 (or 22 if this fails) using USBmuxd's built-in iProxy tool:

- iproxy 2222 44

**Step 6.** Enter the following command in a new Terminal window by pressing Command + T:

- ssh root@localhost -p 2222

**Step 7.** To move the setup file and patch the system, enter the following commands:

- mount -o rw,union,update /
- mv /Applications/Setup.app /Applications/Setup.bak
- rm -rf /Applications/Setup.app

**Step 8.** Lastly, enter these two commands to clear any springboard processes and clear the setup file's cache:

- uicache -all
- Killall backboardd

Checkra1n will bypass the iCloud Activation Lock after you enter the last command.

Using the Terminal app and entering many unfamiliar commands may be intimidating for some people, but if you copy exactly what we've shown you, you'll be fine.
