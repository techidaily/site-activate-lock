## Part 3. Remove find my iPhone with Apple support

Another approach that can be taken into consideration is by accessing Apple Support. Contacting Apple Support can be listed as one of the most prolific and conventional methods adopted to retrieve credentials and remove appropriate services readily consumed.

Furthermore, by following the steps described, it is up to the Support to decide on the case and provide you with appropriate results. Few details need to be covered before contacting the Support. By calling them, they would require the following details, at most.

## Part 4. Is it possible to remove the activation lock if it's a secondhand iPhone?

Normally, it is up to the previous user with his Apple ID to provide you with the appropriate credentials to remove the activation lock across the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. For such cases, you need to contact the user himself and explain the reasons for coming up with such a situation. One easy way of confirming the credentials is by going to the locality of the user himself. With this, the phone is just a restart away, followed by the standard activation procedures that would help you remove the Activation Lock across your device.

It isn't easy to follow these steps if you do not own the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device and can't contact the owner. Under such circumstances, you have to use a third-party program. [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) is one of the best programs to remove an iCloud activation lock.

## Conclusion

## How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 14 Pro

Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro.

In this article, I'm going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 14 Pro from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.

## Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone

You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro.

#### **Step 1:** Download the Software

![how to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736110927930.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Connect iDevice

Switch OFF the "Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro" feature and switch ON the "Aeroplane Mode." Connect your Apple iPhone 14 Pro to your Mac using its USB cable and click on the "Start Jailbreak" tab to initiate the jailbreaking process.

#### **Step 3:** Confirmation

A new interface with a screen notification will open up. Carefully read the three steps before proceeding. If you are okay with the information, click on the "Already did" icon. The jailbreaking process will begin from this point.

![start to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736112213161.jpg)

#### **Step 4:** Jailbreak Complete
