It might seem daunting. Don’t worry, as Dr.Fone will be guiding you through this. Just follow the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Toolbox > Screen Unlock > iOS**.

![dr.fone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

![dr.fone connect phone prompt](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-2.png)

- **Step 6:** To identify if your phone is GSM or CDMA, navigate to **Settings > General > About**. If it’s CDMA, cellular/SIM functions won’t work, but other features remain usable. Upon selecting **Unlock Now**, a warning pop-up appears. Confirm by clicking **Got it**.

## Part 4. Method 3: Use Dedicated Third-Party Services To Remove iCloud Lock

Numerous dedicated third-party services, such as IMEICheck.co and iUnlocker.com, offer **activation lock removal** for those seeking alternative solutions. These websites typically work by using the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device’s IMEI number to unlock the associated iCloud account.

Users visit these websites, enter their device’s IMEI number, and request the iCloud unlock service. Depending on the service provider, these platforms process the unlock request, which can take a few days. While convenient, users should exercise caution and ensure they’re using reputable services to avoid potential scams.

## Conclusion

In summary, **removing iCloud Activation Lock** can be crucial for those dealing with locked Apple devices. This article has explored several methods: using the Apple ID password, leveraging the capabilities of Dr.Fone for those without the password, and opting for third-party services.

It’s important to remember that these methods should only be used for legitimate purposes, such as unlocking a device you legally own. Dr.Fone remains a recommended tool for a comprehensive mobile solution, particularly for unlocking needs.
