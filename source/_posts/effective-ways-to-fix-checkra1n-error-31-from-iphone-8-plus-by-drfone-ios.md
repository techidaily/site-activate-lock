**Step 1.** Download Checkra1n from the official website.

**Step 2.** Using the Terminal app, install brew and usbmuxd by entering the following commands:

- /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install…>)"
- brew install usbmuxd

**Step 3.** Launch Checkra1n once those have been installed.

**Step 4.** Follow the instructions to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8 Plus by connecting it to your computer.

**Step 5.** The following command will create a tunnel from Port 2222 to Port 44 (or 22 if this fails) using USBmuxd's built-in iProxy tool:

- iproxy 2222 44

**Step 6.** Enter the following command in a new Terminal window by pressing Command + T:

- ssh root@localhost -p 2222

**Step 7.** To move the setup file and patch the system, enter the following commands:

- mount -o rw,union,update /
- mv /Applications/Setup.app /Applications/Setup.bak
- rm -rf /Applications/Setup.app

**Step 8.** Lastly, enter these two commands to clear any springboard processes and clear the setup file's cache:

- uicache -all
- Killall backboardd

Checkra1n will bypass the iCloud Activation Lock after you enter the last command.

Using the Terminal app and entering many unfamiliar commands may be intimidating for some people, but if you copy exactly what we've shown you, you'll be fine.
