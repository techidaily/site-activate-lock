## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 12 or iPad?

Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.

This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 12 option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 12. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 12 or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.
