- **Step 2:** The following screen will display the connection status of the iDevice when it is linked to your PC. Choose the **Unlock Now** button to proceed.
- **Step 3:** After this, the platform will inquire about the Apple ID via a series of questions before granting access. Examine your iOS device to see if it has a screen lock feature. Be sure your iDevice has a screen lock enabled before selecting **Yes**.

- **Step 4:** The next step is to check if Two-Factor Authentication is enabled on all your iOS devices. If it’s not already on, toggle it on and click **Yes** to proceed with unlocking the Apple ID.
- **Step 5:** Once you’ve confirmed these choices, you’ll see a screen with instructions for entering Recovery Mode on your iDevice. If it doesn’t work, select **Try DFU Mode** in the screen’s bottom-left corner and follow the steps corresponding to your iOS version. To continue with the unlocking process, follow the instructions that will be displayed.

- **Step 6:** The next screen will show you the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device’s details after entering Recovery Mode. Now that you have the **Device Model**, all you have to do is choose the **System Version** and hit the **Start** button. On the other hand, pick the details by hand and go forward if there are recognition discrepancies.
