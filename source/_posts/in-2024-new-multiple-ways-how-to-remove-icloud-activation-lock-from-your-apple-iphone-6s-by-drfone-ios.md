This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods.

Step 7: If your device is not detected by the platform, follow the on-screen instructions to put their iOS device in DFU Mode.

![no device detected](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-14.png)

Step 8: Once the Apple iPhone 6s device has been processed under the DFU Mode, the computer’s screen will start displaying the removal of the iCloud Activation Lock. When it’s done, click Done in the next window.

Your iPhone will start like a default phone without any activation lock. You can access and utilize the Apple iPhone 6s now. Possibly, remember that you can't utilize your new Apple ID's phone call, cellular, and iCloud feature after that process.


## Part 2: FAQs

### 1\. What is Find My?

The Find My feature is an incredible method for keeping your Apple iPhone 6s from getting lost, as it permits you to find and lock it, regardless of whether you have it. For instance, when Find My iPhone is initiated, you can see where your Apple iPhone 6s is. You might use it to show your location to others or play a sound on your lost device, making it easier to find.

To utilize this feature, you need to initiate this feature on your device and utilize a PC or another phone to find, reset or lock your lost iPhone. If you're selling your Apple iPhone 6s or gifting it to someone else, you should first switch off the Find My feature. It becomes very awkward for the next user if the past owner's Find My iPhone feature is still activated.

### 2\. How to turn off Find My?

If you want to reset your Apple iPhone 6s to erase every one of the data and return it to its default condition, Apple expects you to switch off Find My in advance. Also, experts at the Apple store frequently expect you to switch it off before they can repair it.

Switching it off will not erase any of your data, so you don't have to stress over that. It'll simply make it difficult to track down your Apple iPhone 6s on a map when lost.

The best way to switch off the Find My feature is very direct. The following steps will tell you how to make it happen:

- Open the Settings of your Apple iPhone 6s and tap your name or profile.
- Explore the "Find My" option and go for "Find My iPhone."
- If the Find My iPhone feature is initiated, the toggle button on top of the page should be green. Switch the "Find My iPhone" toggle key to turn it off.
- Enter your Apple ID details.
- Affirm your activity, and that's all you need to turn this feature off.

### 3\. Can I bypass iOS Devices like iPad or iPods?

Yes, you can bypass the activation lock on iPhones like iPad and iPods. However, the method is a bit different regarding Apple Watches.

### The Bottom Line

We hope you are now in a position to bypass Apple iPhone 6s activation lock. This guide mentions the best methods you can employ to bypass this issue, but we all know each method has its pros and cons. Even if no other method works in your case, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) will still help you. This tool is built to provide safe iOS unlocking solutions for our readers.
