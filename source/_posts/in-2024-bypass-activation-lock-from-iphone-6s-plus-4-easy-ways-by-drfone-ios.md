## Part 2: FAQs

### 1\. What is Find My?

The Find My feature is an incredible method for keeping your Apple iPhone 6s Plus from getting lost, as it permits you to find and lock it, regardless of whether you have it. For instance, when Find My iPhone is initiated, you can see where your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is. You might use it to show your location to others or play a sound on your lost device, making it easier to find.

To utilize this feature, you need to initiate this feature on your device and utilize a PC or another phone to find, reset or lock your lost iPhone. If you're selling your Apple iPhone 6s Plus or gifting it to someone else, you should first switch off the Find My feature. It becomes very awkward for the next user if the past owner's Find My iPhone feature is still activated.

### 2\. How to turn off Find My?

If you want to reset your Apple iPhone 6s Plus to erase every one of the data and return it to its default condition, Apple expects you to switch off Find My in advance. Also, experts at the Apple store frequently expect you to switch it off before they can repair it.

Switching it off will not erase any of your data, so you don't have to stress over that. It'll simply make it difficult to track down your Apple iPhone 6s Plus on a map when lost.

The best way to switch off the Find My feature is very direct. The following steps will tell you how to make it happen:

- Open the Settings of your Apple iPhone 6s Plus and tap your name or profile.
- Explore the "Find My" option and go for "Find My iPhone."
- If the Find My iPhone feature is initiated, the toggle button on top of the page should be green. Switch the "Find My iPhone" toggle key to turn it off.
- Enter your Apple ID details.
- Affirm your activity, and that's all you need to turn this feature off.

### 3\. Can I bypass iOS Devices like iPad or iPods?

Yes, you can bypass the activation lock on iPhones like iPad and iPods. However, the method is a bit different regarding Apple Watches.

### The Bottom Line

We hope you are now in a position to bypass Apple iPhone 6s Plus activation lock. This guide mentions the best methods you can employ to bypass this issue, but we all know each method has its pros and cons. Even if no other method works in your case, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS) will still help you. This tool is built to provide safe iOS unlocking solutions for our readers.
