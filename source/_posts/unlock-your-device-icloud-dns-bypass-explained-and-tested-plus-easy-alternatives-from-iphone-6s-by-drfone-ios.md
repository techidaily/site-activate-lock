The iCloud activation lock has a couple of issues. For example, if your Apple iPhone 6s is locked and you forgot your Apple ID details. You won't be able to reactivate your device after resetting it. Another issue you could confront is buying an iPhone connected to the past owner's iCloud account. It makes the smartphone a costly paperweight.
