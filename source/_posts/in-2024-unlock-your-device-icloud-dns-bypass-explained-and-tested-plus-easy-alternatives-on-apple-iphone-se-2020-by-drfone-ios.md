## Unlock Your Device: iCloud DNS Bypass Explained and Tested, Plus Easy Alternatives On Apple iPhone SE (2020)

Have you bought a used iPhone or iPad with an active iCloud Activation Lock? Or perhaps you have an Apple device but cannot remember your iCloud password? Without activating iCloud, you cannot utilize locked devices in either scenario.

You might try contacting Apple customer service, but they won't be able to assist you without user identification directly.

The readable names are transformed into numerical IP addresses via the Domain Name System (DNS). To launch the program, it makes use of a DNS server that serves as a host.

## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13/.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.

If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.

## Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?

If your Apple iPhone SE (2020) is lost or stolen, one of the first steps you should take is to erase the data remotely. This not only protects your personal information but also removes the activation lock.

**Note:** Before proceeding, one should know that once all the data is erased from your Apple iPhone SE (2020), you will no longer be able to use 'Find my iPhone' and all your data will be erased.

### Steps to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone

1. Launch Find My iPhone on any iOS device and enter your account credentials. You can use any iOS device for this procedure.

2. Once you log in, you'll be able to view all the Apple iPhone SE (2020) devices linked to your account. Select the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device you wish to erase.
3. Please note that your device will be viewable only if the Find my iPhone feature is on your lost device and is active.

    ![find-my-iphone-erase](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/icloud-locked-how-to-bypass-icloud-activation-on-iphone-3.jpg)
