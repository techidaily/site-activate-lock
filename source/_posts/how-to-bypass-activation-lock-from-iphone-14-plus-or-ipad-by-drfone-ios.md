## How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad?

Apple has long been famous for providing sound devices, with nifty safety and user-friendly features. With that said, if you just purchased a used iOS device, you may be required to bypass the activation lock on your device using iCloud, or the previous user’s account.

## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad?

This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery. Without access to the owner’s Apple ID and/or password, accessing the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device becomes impossible. Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.

This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.

## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

Using a valid Apple ID and password is the easiest way to bypass the activation lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad Mini. In any case, if you legitimately purchased the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device from the previous owner, they should have no qualms giving you these details. If it’s a new device, and you are the original owner, you will have this information ready to use for activation. Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad Mini.

![add apple id password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/add-apple-id-password.jpg)

- **Step 1.** Have the previous owner enter their details on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad Mini, or request them to send the same to you.
- **Step 2.** Fire up the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and when prompted on the Activation Lock Screen, enter the Apple ID and password.
- **Step 3.** Within a few minutes, the home screen should appear on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad.
- **Step 4.** Upon reaching this page, navigate to the settings tab to sign out of iCloud.

_**A note for users before we proceed with the bypass steps:**  
Users on iOS 12 or earlier can locate this option on settings, navigating to iCloud, then signing out. For iOS 13 or later, click on settings, then your name, and sign out._

- **Step 5.** Chances are, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad will prompt you to enter the original user’s ID and Password. Simply enter the details available to you.
- **Step 6.** Finally, the best part of the unlocking process; navigate to the settings tab to erase all data. Open up settings, click reset and proceed to erase all content, including settings.
- **Step 7.** At this point, your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad will restart/reboot, allowing you to set up the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device anew.

There are a few web-based resources and tricks that facilitate this procedure. Suffice to say, these methods, known as Jailbreaking, do not work when activation lock is enabled.

## How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 14 Plus

Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.

In this article, I'm going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 14 Plus from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone 14 Plus"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.

## Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone

You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.
