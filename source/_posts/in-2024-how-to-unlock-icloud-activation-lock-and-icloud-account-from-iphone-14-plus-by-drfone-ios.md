### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost. Your Apple iPhone 14 Plus should be iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6S, or 6S + to have the services of the iCloud activation lock.
