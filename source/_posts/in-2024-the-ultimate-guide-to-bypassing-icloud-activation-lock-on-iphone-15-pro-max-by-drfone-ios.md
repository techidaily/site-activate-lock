## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

## Part 2: FAQs

**1\. What can iCloud activation lock do for us?**

Activation Lock assists you with keeping your device secure, regardless of whether it's in the wrong hands. Moreover, it can increase your possibility of recovering the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Regardless of whether you delete your device remotely, the activation lock can keep on stopping anybody from reactivating your device without your consent.

However, you should keep the Find My feature enabled. Also, it would help if you remember your Apple ID credentials.

With WatchOS 2, the activation lock can safeguard your Apple Watch. What's more, macOS Catalina or later and Mac PCs with the Apple T2 or Apple Silicon chip can utilize the activation lock to keep your computer safe.

**2\. Can all iPad/iPod/Apple Watch/Mac activation locks be bypassed?**

As mentioned above, one can remove the activation lock with a few simple steps. Moreover, if none of these methods work, Dr.Fone is still there for the rescue. You can use their advanced tools to unlock all locks on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad, iPod, or Apple watches.

**3\. How to turn off Find My?**

- Open the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max Settings and tap your name.
- Explore “Find My” and go to "Find My iPhone".
- If Find My iPhone is enabled, the toggle button on top of the page should be green. Switch the button to turn it off.
- Enter your Mac ID password to confirm, and you're ready.
