### Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password

The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 11 and ask for their Apple ID and password. To **bypass Apple iPhone 11**, you need to have some data in hand:

- Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you're the second owner.
- If a device doesn't have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 11 passcode.

![enter icloud details](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 11 iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 11 device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.
- **Step 3:** Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.
- **Step 4:** Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.

However, if you see the Apple iPhone 11 passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 11 device without the iCloud account.

With the Apple iPhone 11 device set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.

## Part 3. FAQs About Activation Lock on Mac

1. **Is Bypassing Activation Lock Legal?**

Bypassing Activation Lock mechanisms frequently fall into a legal gray area. The intention can be to regain access to a locked device legitimately owned by the user.
