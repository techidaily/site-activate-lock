![owners apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 8 Plus iCloud bypass**:

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.
