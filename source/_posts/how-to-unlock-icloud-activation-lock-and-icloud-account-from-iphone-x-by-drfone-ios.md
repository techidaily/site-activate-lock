## Part 1: Basic knowledge about iCloud activation lock

### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone X, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost. Your Apple iPhone X should be iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6S, or 6S + to have the services of the iCloud activation lock. For phones on iOS 7 and above versions, the activation lock is auto-enabled once the Apple iPhone X is switched on.

### What is the iCloud activation lock used for?

An iCloud lock is basically for the security of an individual’s phone to not misuse and your details are safe. Once the 'Find My iPhone’ feature is enabled on your Apple devices, Apple’s activation server saves your Apple Id. Henceforth whenever your phone is turned off or performs any type of action such as erasing the Apple iPhone X device or reactivating the Apple iPhone X device, then your device will ask for unlocking iCloud activation.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone X was iCloud activation locked?

If you are purchasing an iPhone or any other Apple device from someone, you need to make sure that the Apple device is no longer linked to the prior owner's account. To make sure you are on the safe side, you could check it for yourself. There are two ways to check:

1\. You can visit [https://icloud.com/activationlock](https://icloud.com/activationlock) from any Computer or MAC to check the present Activation Lock status of the Apple iPhone X device.

2\. Follow the steps below to be sure that you can use your Apple iPhone X device hassle-free:

1) Switch on the Apple iPhone X device and slide to unlock it.

If the screen displays a passcode lock screen or you can see the Home Screen, the Apple iPhone X device you have purchased has not been erased.
