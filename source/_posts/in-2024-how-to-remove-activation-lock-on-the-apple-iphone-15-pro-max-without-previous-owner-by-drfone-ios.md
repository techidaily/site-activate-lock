**Step 1.** Visit the Apple iPhone unlock website from a browser.

**Step 2.** Enter the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device IMEI or the serial number of your iPad and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max and send it.

**Step 3.** Wait for an affirmation message informing you that the iCloud lock has been removed.

**Step 4.** Presently, make another iCloud account and start using your iPad.

### Method 3. iCloud DNS Bypass

Since your iPad and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is locked, you cannot access anything until you unlock your Apple device. One method for unlocking an iCloud-locked device is to use the DNS bypass by following the steps underneath:

**Step 1.** Take your iPad, and remember that on the “Activate iPhone” screen, press the home button and afterward press the "Wi-Fi" settings. Close to the Wi-Fi image, tap on the “I” symbol. Now you need to change the current DNS settings of your iPad. The DNS settings you want to type are as per the following:

- For users in the USA, type in 104.154.51.7
- In Europe, type 104.155.28.90
- In Asia, type 104.155.220.58
- For other parts of the world, key in 78.109.17.60

**Step 2.** Click the “Back” button, then Done. Then, click the “Activation help” option. You will see a message saying you have connected to my server whenever you do that. You will get to various iCloud services if you tap on the menu. Furthermore, you can access the User's Chat, Mail, Social, Video, YouTube, and other things from there.

## Part 2: How to Unlock iCloud Locked iPad and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max with Apple ID and Password?

The least demanding way is to use the Apple ID username and password initially used to activate the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Follow these steps to finish the Activation Lock bypass:

- Please turn on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and enter the first Apple ID credentials when it gets to the Activation Lock screen (or ask the individual who sold you the iPad).
- It will permit the iPad and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max to boot up. At the point when the iPad and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max gets to the home screen, sign out of iCloud.

On iOS 10.2 and older, tap Settings > iCloud > Sign Out.

On iOS 10.3 and newer, go to Settings and tap on your name > Sign Out.
