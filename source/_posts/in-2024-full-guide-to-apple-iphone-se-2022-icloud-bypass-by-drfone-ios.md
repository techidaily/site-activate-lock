## Part 1: Basic information about iCloud lock

### What Does iCloud Lock Mean?

Part of the normal process of setting up a new iPhone is to register the phone with an Apple ID. Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone SE (2022) and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to [bypass the iCloud activation](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html) lock.

However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details.

The Apple iPhone SE (2022) is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.

Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, **checking the iCloud Activation Lock status** is important. Here’s how:

- **Step 1:** Power on the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device has been properly erased.

![iphone lockscreen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg)

- **Step 3:** During the setup, if the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.

If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an **activation lock check** when buying second-hand phones.
