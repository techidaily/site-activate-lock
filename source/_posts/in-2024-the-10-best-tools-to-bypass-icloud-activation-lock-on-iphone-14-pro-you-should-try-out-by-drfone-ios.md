## Part 1: What Is iCloud Activation Lock? And How Does It Work?

Apple's iCloud Activation Lock feature is designed to prevent anyone from using your iOS device if your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, iPad, or iPod Touch gets lost or stolen. This feature automatically turns on when you activate **Find My** on your device.

Even as you erase your information remotely, iCloud Activation Lock improves your chances of recovering your lost iOS device by keeping your Find My turned on. This feature deters anyone from reactivating your device without your permission.

## Part 2: The Best iCloud Activation Lock Bypass Tools You Can Use

If you forget your iCloud password for some reason, you will need to use a special program to bypass your iOS device. While using an activation app is not illegal, it's only recommended for people who need to get access to their iOS device when they've forgotten their iCloud ID and password.

Here is a list of iCloud activation lock tools and services that are highly talked about today, and we will help you make a better choice through the next analysis.

### 1\. Ask the previous device owner for Apple ID and passcode

For an iPhone activation lock bypass, you'll require a couple of data:

**The owner's Apple ID email and secret word.** If you want to know how to bypass Activation Lock on iPhone or iPad, it's frequently just about as straightforward as signing into the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the past owner.

**The owner's four or six-digit passcodes.** You might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock if a device isn't deleted.

![owner id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-xs-xr-x-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

The following steps show the way to **bypass Apple iPhone 14 Pro** activation lock:

- Turn on your phone and follow the on-screen prompts to set up the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device (language, WiFi, and so forth.)
- When you see the "Sign In with Apple ID" screen, enter the Appl ID credentials of the previous owner.
- With the correct credentials given, the process can proceed.
- On the other hand, if you see the passcode screen, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device without Apple ID.

With the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device fully set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the iCloud account. You can now make one more ID and sign into it.
