![activation lock page ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device to a specific Apple ID.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.

## Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password

If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device, learning **how to remove iCloud Activation Lock** is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.

Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to **Settings >** Tap on the profile on top of the app > **Sign Out**.

![icloud sign out button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-02.jpg)

### Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)

Alternatively, you can remove the iCloud account by following the steps below. You can ask the original owner to do this or do it independently if you can access the account.

- **Step 1:** Go to <www.iCloud.com/find> on any web browser.
- **Step 2:** Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device owner’s ID) and password.

- **Step 3.** Once your device is connected, choose the “Unlock Apple ID” option. The tool will guide you through the process, and you will be prompted to trust the computer on your device.
- **Step 4.** Follow the on-screen instructions to unlock your iCloud account. Dr.Fone will initiate the unlocking process, and once completed, your iCloud account will be accessible without the need for a password.

## Conclusion

From the methods mentioned above, it’s easy to see that it only takes a matter of days to unlock the iCloud account or to completely remove the stubborn iCloud lock. The diversity of both methods allows you to easily pick and use the best method that suits your preferences. Regardless of whether you want to download iCloud remover, or you simply want to go for an easy-to-use and pocket-friendly online platform, the fact remains that both of these methods have got you covered.

The iCloud unlocker download method though effective requires a lot of time to go through it and don’t forget the amount of money used to get it working. On the other hand, what I like about our second method is the fact that it's more efficient and easy to use. With it, I don't have to go through the tiring and complex downloading process, since the company itself bypasses the lock and renders My Apple iPhone 15 Plus usable.
