## How To Bypass iCloud By Checkra1n Even On Apple iPhone 8 If You've Tried Everything

Since iOS 12.3, Apple has been using its new Activation Lock feature to deter theft. This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.

While this is a welcomed addition for those looking to protect their device, it can also be a major inconvenience for those who have lost or forgotten their iCloud password. Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information. You will learn in this post how to use Checkra1n iCloud bypass to unlock your Apple iPhone 8 or iPad.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: What is Checkra1n?

Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8 or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.

Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don't know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.

Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don't know the passcode.

**Pros**

- The tool doesn't require tech skills
- It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices
- Supports a wide range of hardware platforms
- It is not possible to exploit remotely

**Cons**

- Jailbreaking older devices is limited
- A reboot won't save them
