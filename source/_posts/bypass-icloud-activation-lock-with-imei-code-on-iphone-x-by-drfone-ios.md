## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone X device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone X device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

## Part 2: What is Find My?

By all accounts, Apple's Find My feature does what it says. If you lose your Apple iPhone X, you can recognize its latest area using the iCloud Site, and you can make it play a sound.

Yet, Find My iPhone does substantially more! You can utilize it to find a missing Macintosh, iPad, iPod, and even AirPods. It also safeguards your data on the off chance a gadget is stolen. It even works with Family Sharing to find phones claimed by anybody in your family.

## Part 3: How to Disable Find My?

When you switch off Find My feature on your iDevice, the Activation Lock is naturally switched off. Here's how:

- Go to Settings, click on your account (your account name) and click the "Find My" option on your iDevice.
