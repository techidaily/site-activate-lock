## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone X device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone X device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

### Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

DNS represents the domain name and is a supportive method for bypassing the Apple iPhone X activation lock. It controls the DNS server and redirects the authentication way of your phone. It assists you with the Apple iPhone X iCloud bypass using these steps:

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-se-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

**Step 1.** Go to the Wi-Fi settings and click Configure IP. Then choose Manual and click "Add Server."

**Step 2.** Click on the "i" and enter the DNS server IP according to your area, which is:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- The rest: 78.100.17.60

**Step 3.** Go back and turn on Wi-Fi.

**Step 4.** Tap on Next Page and go back to bypass the lock.

**Step 5.** Set up the gadget according to your liking.

The downside of this strategy is that it is short-term. When you reboot your iOS gadget, the activation lock comes back up, and you'll need to do it again. That can get irritating and wasteful.

### Method 4. Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)

## Part 2: What is Find My?

## Part 3: How to Disable Find My?
