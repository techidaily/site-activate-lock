## Part 1: 4 Efficient Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone SE (2020) iCloud Activation Lock

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner

For an **Apple iPhone SE (2020) iCloud bypass**, you'll require a couple of significant pieces of data:

- Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.
- If a device doesn't have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone SE (2020) passcode in mind.

![owners apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone SE (2020) iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone SE (2020).
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.
- **Step 3:** Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.
- **Step 4:** Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.

On the other hand, if you see the lock screen passcode, you can type the passcode and set up the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device without the Apple ID.

With the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device completely set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.

### 2\. Use DNS Bypass

**What is DNS?**

Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.

You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can't utilize the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform **Apple iPhone SE (2020) iCloud bypass** via DNS bypass.

**Steps to Follow:**

**Note:** Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.

- **Step 1:** Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.

_**Note:** If you don't see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button> More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it._

- **Step 3:** You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.
- **Step 4:** Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90

- **Step 5:** After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.
- **Step 6:** You will see the next page choice; don't click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone SE (2020) from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone SE (2020)"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.
