If you have an iPod and Apple iPhone SE locked by iCloud, you'll need the previous owner's Apple ID and password to bypass the activation lock and use the Apple iPhone SE device. iCloud activation locks are put in place to protect your device and data, but if you've purchased a used iPod and Apple iPhone SE from someone who didn't remove their account information, you'll be stuck with a locked device.

### Method 3. DNS Bypass

To remove the iCloud Activation Lock iPod and Apple iPhone SE from the Apple iPhone SE device, you can use a DNS server or HTML. When you have no other choice, it's worth a shot. Please note that this method only works with newer versions of iOS, such as iOS 10.

**Step 1:** Start the Apple iPhone SE device or restart it if it is already on.

**Step 2:** Select "Choose Wi-Fi network" during the setup process.

**Step 3:** Click "More Wi-Fi Settings" and tap the "I" icon next to the Wi-Fi network.

**Step 4:** Click "Configure DNS" and choose "Manual".

**Step 5:** Select "+Add Server" and enter the server's address at your location. Use the following server addresses:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Africa, Australia, and other locations: 78.109.17.60

**Step 6:** After tapping "Save", click on the back option and select "Ask to Join Networks".

**Step 7:** Enter the network password and then tap "Join".

**Step 8:** To set up the Apple iPhone SE device normally, tap on the back button when it tries to activate.
