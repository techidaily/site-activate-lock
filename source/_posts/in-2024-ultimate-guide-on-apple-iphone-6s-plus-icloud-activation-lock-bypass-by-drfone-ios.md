For instance, when Find My iPhone is initiated, you can see where your Apple iPhone 6s Plus is. You might use it to show your location to others or play a sound on your lost device, making it easier to find.

To utilize this feature, you need to initiate this feature on your device and utilize a PC or another phone to find, reset or lock your lost iPhone.

The best way to switch off the Find My feature is very direct. The following steps will tell you how to make it happen:

- Open the Settings of your Apple iPhone 6s Plus and tap your name or profile.
- Explore the "Find My" option and go for "Find My iPhone."
