## Latest Guide on iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone XS iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

Nowadays, many purchase a used iPhone instead of a fresh, out-of-the-box new one. Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone XS device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone XS device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.

It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials. However, we've discovered a few potential ways to **bypass iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone XS**. Also, we will introduce you to the best and expert bypass tool available in the market. Therefore, we strongly suggest you stay with us and download Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.

### Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner

However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone XS device.

**Step 2.** On your iPad, go to the "Settings" application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.

- If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to "iCloud" and sign out.
- If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click "Sign Out."
