- **Step 4:** The next step is to check if Two-Factor Authentication is enabled on all your iOS devices. If it’s not already on, toggle it on and click **Yes** to proceed with unlocking the Apple ID.
- **Step 5:** Once you’ve confirmed these choices, you’ll see a screen with instructions for entering Recovery Mode on your iDevice. If it doesn’t work, select **Try DFU Mode** in the screen’s bottom-left corner and follow the steps corresponding to your iOS version. To continue with the unlocking process, follow the instructions that will be displayed.

- **Step 6:** The next screen will show you the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device’s details after entering Recovery Mode. Now that you have the **Device Model**, all you have to do is choose the **System Version** and hit the **Start** button. On the other hand, pick the details by hand and go forward if there are recognition discrepancies.

- **Step 7:** The download of the corresponding iOS firmware begins, and the progress is shown on the following screen. If the firmware download is taking too long for your platform, you can directly download it by clicking the **Copy** button to copy the link.
- **Step 8:** The following screen will show details of the firmware after it has been confirmed by the platform after its download. To proceed with unlocking your Apple ID, click the **Unlock Now** button.

- **Step 9:** To proceed, a confirmation window will pop up and ask for a code. To begin, input the code and then click **Unlock**. You can see how far along the process of unlocking Apple ID is on the screen that follows. Do not allow the gadget to become disconnected in any way.

- **Step 10:** After the Apple ID is unlocked, the screen will ask you to finish the process. If your Apple ID has been unlocked, you can finish by clicking the **Done** button. If that isn’t the case, you may use the **Try Again** button to start over.
