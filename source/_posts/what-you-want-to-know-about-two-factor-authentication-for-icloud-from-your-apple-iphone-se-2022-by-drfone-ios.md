Looking for a tool to jailbreak an iOS device on a Mac? Wondershare Dr.Fone has you covered there, as it also provides a comprehensive guide to jailbreaking an iOS device from Mac. You will need to download the Checkra1n tool and a USB cable to connect your Apple iPhone SE (2022). Once you have both, use the following steps to jailbreak your device from Mac:

- **Step 1.** Begin by downloading the .dmg file of Checkra1n and installing it within your Mac's applications. Now, link your iOS device to the Mac and go to Applications, click "Checkra1n," and access "Contents."

- **Step 3.** Tap "Next," put your device into [<u>DFU Mode</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/dfu-mode/tools-for-iphone-to-enter-dfu-mode.html), and press "Start." Once the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device is in DFU Mode, the jailbreaking process will commence. When it is complete, and your device is jailbroken, tap "Done" to conclude the process.
