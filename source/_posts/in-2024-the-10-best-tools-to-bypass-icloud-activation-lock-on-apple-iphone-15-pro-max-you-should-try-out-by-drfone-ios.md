## How To Bypass iCloud By Checkra1n Even On Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max If You've Tried Everything

Since iOS 12.3, Apple has been using its new Activation Lock feature to deter theft. This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.

Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don't know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.

Navigating through the iCloud **Activation Lock on a MacBook** can be daunting. This is especially true when faced with legitimate scenarios like forgotten passwords. It can also happen in the case of purchasing pre-owned locked devices. Yet, several methods and techniques exist to bypass this security feature. Below, we'll go through various methods for how to bypass iCloud **Activation Lock on Mac**:

### Fix 1. Retrieve Your Password

Forgetting the Apple ID password can often lead to being locked out of your own device due to the iCloud Activation Lock. Fortunately, Apple provides a streamlined process to reset and retrieve forgotten passwords. This allows users to regain entry to their devices. Apple offers a mechanism to reset forgotten passwords via the Apple ID account recovery process.

Visit the [Apple ID account page](https://appleid.apple.com/sign-in) through a web browser on any device.

### Fix 2. Remove Mac Activation Lock from Another Device

When faced with a Mac locked by iCloud Activation Lock, another effective method exists. You can bypass this security measure using another trusted device. That device must be linked to the same Apple ID as the Mac. Employing this method allows you to remove the Activation Lock from the locked Mac through the “Find My” feature. Follow these steps to bypass the **Mac Activation Lock**:

**Step 1.** Utilize a different Apple device, like an iPhone, iPad, or another Mac, that is currently signed in with the identical Apple ID. From there, navigate to the [iCloud website](https://www.icloud.com/) and sign in using your Apple account credentials.
