## Part 1: 4 Quick Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 Pro iCloud activation lock

### Method 1. Ask the previous owner for Apple ID and passcode

The first thing you can do is to [ask the previous owner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-to-remove-activation-lock-without-previous-owner.html) for their Apple iCloud account credentials. You can use these details to open the account and use it for the **Apple iPhone 14 Pro bypass**.

However, it is the least suggested and least effective method. It is because asking someone about their account details is unethical. The iCloud account has a lot of personal information about the user. Therefore, no one will be willing to hand you the account credentials unless they are your close relatives.

- Europe: 104.155.28.90

## Part 1: How to bypass iCloud activation on iPhone through the DNS method?

This method is one of the oldest tricks in the guide, and while it still works for some users with specific models and iOS versions, it doesn't guarantee universal success. Here's a brief overview of how to proceed:

![bypass icloud activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/icloud-locked-how-to-bypass-icloud-activation-on-iphone-9_643.jpg)

In the activation window, press the home button and then select Wi-Fi settings and then tap on the 'I' bonded by a circle. Now it's time to remove the existing DNS server and put a custom one in motion. Now, let's follow the steps below to bypass iCloud activation on iPhone.

### How to bypass iCloud activation lock?

#### Step 1: Start the Setup Process

Turn on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and start the setup process until you reach the page where you're asked to connect to a Wi-Fi network.

#### Step 2: Select a Custom DNS Server

When prompted to connect to a Wi-Fi network and input a password, select "i" on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro screen, which will take you to a menu with network details. Tap "Configure DNS" and choose "Manual".

Enter a DNS server address based on your geographic location:

- For USA/North America, enter 104.154.51.7
- For Europe, enter 104.155.28.90
- For Asia, enter 104.155.220.58
- For any other area, enter 78.109.17.60

#### Step 3: Proceed with iCloud Bypass

Return to Wi-Fi settings and select your desired network. You might need to enter a password, but instead, you can skip this step and continue. Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro will try to activate with these new settings and may allow you to bypass the activation lock.

**Note:** The DNS method is an experimental and non-guaranteed way to bypass the iCloud activation lock. It is worth trying if you prefer not to use third-party tools, but be prepared for the possibility that it may not work for your specific device or iOS version.

**Tips:** During iCloud, we use it most for data backup to avoid data loss. But if you can't access your iCloud, maybe you are supposed to back up [your iPhone data to the computer](https://drfone.wondershare.com/backup-iphone/how-to-backup-iphone.html).

## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13/.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.

If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.
