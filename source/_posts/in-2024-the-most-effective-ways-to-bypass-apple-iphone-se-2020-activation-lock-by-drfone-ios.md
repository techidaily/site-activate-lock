#### Step-by-Step Guide to Bypass Activation Lock

There are some steps that you need to follow in order to **bypass the Activation Lock** using Wondershare Dr.Fone. These steps are:

**Step 1: Install and Download Dr.Fone, and Select Remove Active Lock**

**Step 2: Jailbreak and Confirm Device Information**

Now jailbreak your Apple iPhone SE (2020), and once it is done, a warning message will appear on the screen. You need to “Tick” the confirmation statement that you agree with the terms and conditions and click on the “Next” button. You are also required to confirm the information, like the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device model.
