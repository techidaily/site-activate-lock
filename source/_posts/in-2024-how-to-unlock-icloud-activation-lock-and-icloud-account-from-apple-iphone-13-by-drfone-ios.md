An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 13, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost.

Once the 'Find My iPhone’ feature is enabled on your Apple devices, Apple’s activation server saves your Apple Id.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone 13 was iCloud activation locked?
