## New Multiple Ways: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock On your Apple iPhone 14 Pro

Undeniably, one of Apple’s selling points is its focus on security. iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple stuff all enjoy this robust security system. Of course, this is mainly made by Apple through iCloud or Apple ID. This system is designed to protect your data and prevent unauthorized access. This is what makes Apple’s devices highly secure and sought after.

However, a common challenge arises when you acquire a second-hand iPhone or iPad. You may find it’s connected to the previous owner’s iCloud account through an Activation Lock. This situation can be a significant hurdle, rendering the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device almost unusable. As you may expect, this article will help you **remove the iCloud Activation Lock**.

![activation lock page ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device to a specific Apple ID.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.

## Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password

If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, learning **how to remove iCloud Activation Lock** is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.

If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to **Settings >** Tap on the profile on top of the app > **Sign Out**.

![icloud sign out button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-02.jpg)

If you’ve forgotten your Apple ID, it can be recovered by signing in with your Apple ID account. Then, click the **Forgot Password** button. You may need to answer security questions or receive a code on a trusted device to complete this process.

### Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)

Alternatively, you can remove the iCloud account by following the steps below. You can ask the original owner to do this or do it independently if you can access the account.

- **Step 1:** Go to <www.iCloud.com/find> on any web browser.
- **Step 2:** Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device owner’s ID) and password.

![login with apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-03.jpg)

- **Step 3:** From the list of devices associated with this Apple ID, select the one you wish to unlock.
- **Step 4:** Click **Remove from Account**. This action will disassociate the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device from the Apple ID, removing the Activation Lock.

Following these steps, you can **remove the iCloud Activation Lock** from your device, provided you can access the necessary Apple ID credentials. This method is the most secure and straightforward way to regain access to your device without compromising your data or the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device’s functionality.

## How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 14 Pro

Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro.

In this article, I'm going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 14 Pro from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.

## Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone

You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Pro.
