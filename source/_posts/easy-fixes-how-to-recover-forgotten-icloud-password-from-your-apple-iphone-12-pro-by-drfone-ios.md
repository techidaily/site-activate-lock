#### How to Jailbreak on Windows and Mac

Jailbreak on Mac and Windows should be the first thing you need to do when you are going to **bypass the Activation Lock**. As we know, many available tools in the market are not compatible with it. You should know what needs to be prepared before you jailbreak on Windows and Mac.

##### Jailbreak on Windows

The first thing you need to make sure of is that your computer runs on version 7 or above, and you have a USB flash drive with 2 GB capacity. After that, download the "[checkn1x-amd64.iso](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/checkn1x-amd64.iso)" and "[WinRa1n2.0](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=10620683726822078150)."

##### Jailbreak on Mac

To jailbreak iOS on Mac, download the "[Checkra1n](https://checkra.in/releases/0.12.4-beta#all-downloads)" and then simply try to connect the Mac computer and the iOS device using a USB cable.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Bypass Activation Lock

There are some steps that you need to follow in order to **bypass the Activation Lock** using Wondershare Dr.Fone. These steps are:

**Step 1: Install and Download Dr.Fone, and Select Remove Active Lock**

On your computer system, install and download Wondershare Dr.Fone and hit the “Screen Unlock” module from the main interface. Now go to the “Unlock Apple ID” option and then choose “Remove Active Lock".

You are also required to confirm the information, like the Apple iPhone 12 Pro device model.
