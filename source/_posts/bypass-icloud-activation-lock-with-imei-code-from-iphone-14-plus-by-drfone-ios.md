## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

![remove activation lock on ipod](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/bypass-ipod-activation-lock-2.png)

In this step, the previous owner's iCloud account has been completely removed from the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, and the Activation Lock has also been removed.

### Method 2. Get the Previous Owner's Apple ID and Password

If you have an iPod and Apple iPhone 14 Plus locked by iCloud, you'll need the previous owner's Apple ID and password to bypass the activation lock and use the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. iCloud activation locks are put in place to protect your device and data, but if you've purchased a used iPod and Apple iPhone 14 Plus from someone who didn't remove their account information, you'll be stuck with a locked device.

### Method 3. DNS Bypass

To remove the iCloud Activation Lock iPod and Apple iPhone 14 Plus from the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, you can use a DNS server or HTML. When you have no other choice, it's worth a shot. Please note that this method only works with newer versions of iOS, such as iOS 10.

**Step 1:** Start the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device or restart it if it is already on.

**Step 2:** Select "Choose Wi-Fi network" during the setup process.

**Step 3:** Click "More Wi-Fi Settings" and tap the "I" icon next to the Wi-Fi network.

**Step 4:** Click "Configure DNS" and choose "Manual".

**Step 5:** Select "+Add Server" and enter the server's address at your location. Use the following server addresses:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Africa, Australia, and other locations: 78.109.17.60

**Step 6:** After tapping "Save", click on the back option and select "Ask to Join Networks".

**Step 7:** Enter the network password and then tap "Join".

**Step 8:** To set up the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device normally, tap on the back button when it tries to activate.
