**Step 1:** Open the Apple ID page on your browser and tap on the option of “Forgot Apple ID or Password” to redirect yourselves to a new link.

![click-on-forgot-apple-id-and-password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/remove-find-my-iphone-activation-lock-without-apple-id-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** On the new window, provide your Apple ID along with the assorted phone number and tap "Continue."

Another approach that can be taken into consideration is by accessing Apple Support.

This method might be quite easy and cost less to execute; however, you cannot cover Apple devices bought through secondhand vendors. Furthermore, by following the steps described, it is up to the Support to decide on the case and provide you with appropriate results. Few details need to be covered before contacting the Support. By calling them, they would require the following details, at most.

- The Apple AppleCare agreement number
- The device’s serial number
- The phone’s receipt

By providing the following details, Apple Support may help you remove the Find My iPhone across your device and helps you configure your device easily.
