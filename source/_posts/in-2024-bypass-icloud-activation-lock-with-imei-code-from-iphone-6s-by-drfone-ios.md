## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 6s device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

There are multiple ways that you can do that, and we will share the ways with you below:

### Method 1: Removing the Apple iPhone 6s device from the First Owner's iCloud

Probably one of the easiest and fastest ways to bypass the activation lock is by contacting the owner to remove the Apple iPhone 6s device that you have from their iCloud. If you can still make contact with them, you can try this option and reach out to them.

### Method 2: Contact Apple to Remove The Activation Lock

If you cannot contact the previous owner, you can then [reach out to Apple directly](https://al-support.apple.com/#/kbase) and provide proof that you have inherited or purchased the Apple iPhone 6s device. Documents such as receipts and death certificates if inherited, then you can reach out to their support team to unlock your device.

- **Step 1:** Restart your device.
- **Step 2:** Go through the process of setting up until you come across the “Choose Wi-Fi Network”.
- **Step 3:** Then choose “More Wi-Fi settings” and tap on “I”.
- **Step 4:** Choose “Configure DNS” and select “Manual”.
- **Step 5:** From there, choose “+Add server” then choose the address as per your location below and click “Save”.

- **Step 6:** Select “Ask to Join Networks” and enter the password then click on “Join”.
- **Step 7:** When it tries to activate, you can tap on the back button and proceed to set up the Apple iPhone 6s device as usual.
