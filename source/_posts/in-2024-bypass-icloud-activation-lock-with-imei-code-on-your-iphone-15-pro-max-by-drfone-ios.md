## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number.

## Part 3: How To Bypass iCloud Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max via the DNS Change Method

Apart from using a paid service to bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, you can employ a simple free-to-use unlocking method. One such method is the DNS change process. With this approach, you don’t need to use any paid service, and neither do you have to wait for days for the lock to be bypassed.

Here’s how you can unlock and bypass the iCloud Activation Lock by using the DNS change method.

1: On your iCloud Activation interface, press the “Home” button and select the “WiFi” settings option.

2: On your WiFi settings, tap on the circled “I” icon. This action will open the DNS settings.

4: Once you have entered the DNS digits, tap “Back” and finally tap on the “Done” option.

5: To temporarily bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, tap on the “Activation Help” option. You will get a display message that reads “You have successfully connected to my server”.
