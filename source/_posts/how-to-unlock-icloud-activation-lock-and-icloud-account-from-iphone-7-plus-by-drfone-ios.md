### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 7 Plus, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost. Your Apple iPhone 7 Plus should be iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6S, or 6S + to have the services of the iCloud activation lock.

Once the 'Find My iPhone’ feature is enabled on your Apple devices, Apple’s activation server saves your Apple Id.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone 7 Plus was iCloud activation locked?
