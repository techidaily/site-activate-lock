## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone XS device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone XS device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone XS device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

### Method 3. iCloud DNS Bypass

Since your iPad and Apple iPhone XS is locked, you cannot access anything until you unlock your Apple device. One method for unlocking an iCloud-locked device is to use the DNS bypass by following the steps underneath:

**Step 1.** Take your iPad, and remember that on the “Activate iPhone” screen, press the home button and afterward press the "Wi-Fi" settings. Close to the Wi-Fi image, tap on the “I” symbol. Now you need to change the current DNS settings of your iPad. The DNS settings you want to type are as per the following:

- For users in the USA, type in 104.154.51.7
- In Europe, type 104.155.28.90
- In Asia, type 104.155.220.58
- For other parts of the world, key in 78.109.17.60

**Step 2.** Click the “Back” button, then Done. Then, click the “Activation help” option. You will see a message saying you have connected to my server whenever you do that. You will get to various iCloud services if you tap on the menu. Furthermore, you can access the User's Chat, Mail, Social, Video, YouTube, and other things from there.

## Part 2: How to Unlock iCloud Locked iPad and Apple iPhone XS with Apple ID and Password?

The least demanding way is to use the Apple ID username and password initially used to activate the Apple iPhone XS device. Follow these steps to finish the Activation Lock bypass:

- Please turn on the Apple iPhone XS device and enter the first Apple ID credentials when it gets to the Activation Lock screen (or ask the individual who sold you the iPad).
- It will permit the iPad and Apple iPhone XS to boot up. At the point when the iPad and Apple iPhone XS gets to the home screen, sign out of iCloud.

On iOS 10.2 and older, tap Settings > iCloud > Sign Out.

On iOS 10.3 and newer, go to Settings and tap on your name > Sign Out.

- When the iPad and Apple iPhone XS requests the user's ID credentials, please enter them.
- Presently, eradicate any leftover information and settings on the iPad and Apple iPhone XS by tapping Settings. Go to the General tab and Reset > Erase All Content and Settings.
