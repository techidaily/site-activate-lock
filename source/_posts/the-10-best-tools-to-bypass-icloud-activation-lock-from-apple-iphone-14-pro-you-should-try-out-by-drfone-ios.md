## Part 1: What Is iCloud Activation Lock? And How Does It Work?

Apple's iCloud Activation Lock feature is designed to prevent anyone from using your iOS device if your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, iPad, or iPod Touch gets lost or stolen. This feature automatically turns on when you activate **Find My** on your device.

Even as you erase your information remotely, iCloud Activation Lock improves your chances of recovering your lost iOS device by keeping your Find My turned on. This feature deters anyone from reactivating your device without your permission.

## Part 2: The Best iCloud Activation Lock Bypass Tools You Can Use

If you forget your iCloud password for some reason, you will need to use a special program to bypass your iOS device. While using an activation app is not illegal, it's only recommended for people who need to get access to their iOS device when they've forgotten their iCloud ID and password.

Now you need to change the current DNS settings of your iPad. The DNS settings you want to type are as per the following:

- For users in the USA, type in 104.154.51.7
- In Europe, type 104.155.28.90
- In Asia, type 104.155.220.58
- For other parts of the world, key in 78.109.17.60

**Step 2.** Click the “Back” button, then Done. Then, click the “Activation help” option. You will see a message saying you have connected to my server whenever you do that. You will get to various iCloud services if you tap on the menu. Furthermore, you can access the User's Chat, Mail, Social, Video, YouTube, and other things from there.
