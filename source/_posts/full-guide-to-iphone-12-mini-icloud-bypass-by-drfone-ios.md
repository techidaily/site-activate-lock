## Part 1: 4 Efficient Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone 12 mini iCloud Activation Lock

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner

For an **Apple iPhone 12 mini iCloud bypass**, you'll require a couple of significant pieces of data:

![owners apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 12 mini iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 12 mini.
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 12 mini device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.

- **Step 4:** Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.

With the Apple iPhone 12 mini device completely set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.

### 2\. Use DNS Bypass

You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can't utilize the Apple iPhone 12 mini device.

- **Step 2:** When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.

_**Note:** If you don't see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button> More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it._

- **Step 3:** You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.
- **Step 4:** Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:

- Asia: 104.155.220.58
