## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 13 or iPad?

This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery. Without access to the owner’s Apple ID and/or password, accessing the Apple iPhone 13 device becomes impossible. Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.

This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 13 option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 13. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 13 or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.

## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 13 or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 13 or iPad Mini.
