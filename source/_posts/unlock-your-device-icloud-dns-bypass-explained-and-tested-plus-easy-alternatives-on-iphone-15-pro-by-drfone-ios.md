## Unlock Your Device: iCloud DNS Bypass Explained and Tested, Plus Easy Alternatives On Apple iPhone 15 Pro

Have you bought a used iPhone or iPad with an active iCloud Activation Lock? Or perhaps you have an Apple device but cannot remember your iCloud password? Without activating iCloud, you cannot utilize locked devices in either scenario.

You might try contacting Apple customer service, but they won't be able to assist you without user identification directly. Even after the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device has been authenticated, you will still be bombarded with inquiries, and they may even want the original iOS device payment receipt.

### Fix 5. Consider Using Other Options in Checkra1n

If the reason behind **Checkra1n error 31** is the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device incompatibility, Checkra1n provides an inbuilt way. When jailbreaking a device, Checkra1n allows you to select the "Untested versions" option. While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:

**Instructions.** To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the "Options" and select the "Untested Versions" and "Safe Mode" options. Then, try jailbreaking your device and see if error 31 is resolved.
