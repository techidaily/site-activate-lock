- **Check Cellular or Network Connectivity in Settings**

Navigate to your Apple iPhone 6s Plus’s Settings menu. Head to “Cellular” or “Mobile Data” and ensure it’s switched on. A lit icon signals active connectivity. If using Wi-Fi, look for the Wi-Fi symbol at the top – a strong connection is a green light for activation success.

- **Apple ID and iCloud Integration**
