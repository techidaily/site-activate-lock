## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:
