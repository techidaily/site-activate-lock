## How To Bypass iCloud By Checkra1n Even On Apple iPhone 14 Plus If You've Tried Everything

Since iOS 12.3, Apple has been using its new Activation Lock feature to deter theft. This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.

While this is a welcomed addition for those looking to protect their device, it can also be a major inconvenience for those who have lost or forgotten their iCloud password. Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information. You will learn in this post how to use Checkra1n iCloud bypass to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: What is Checkra1n?

Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.

Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don't know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.

Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don't know the passcode.

**Pros**

- The tool doesn't require tech skills
- It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices
- Supports a wide range of hardware platforms
- It is not possible to exploit remotely

**Cons**

- Jailbreaking older devices is limited
- A reboot won't save them

### What is the iCloud activation lock used for?

An iCloud lock is basically for the security of an individual’s phone to not misuse and your details are safe. Once the 'Find My iPhone’ feature is enabled on your Apple devices, Apple’s activation server saves your Apple Id. Henceforth whenever your phone is turned off or performs any type of action such as erasing the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device or reactivating the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, then your device will ask for unlocking iCloud activation.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone 14 Plus was iCloud activation locked?

If you are purchasing an iPhone or any other Apple device from someone, you need to make sure that the Apple device is no longer linked to the prior owner's account. To make sure you are on the safe side, you could check it for yourself. There are two ways to check:

1\. You can visit [https://icloud.com/activationlock](https://icloud.com/activationlock) from any Computer or MAC to check the present Activation Lock status of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.

2\. Follow the steps below to be sure that you can use your Apple iPhone 14 Plus device hassle-free:

1) Switch on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and slide to unlock it.

If the screen displays a passcode lock screen or you can see the Home Screen, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device you have purchased has not been erased. The seller will go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Ensure the seller clears the phone before he hands it over to you for use.

2) Set up your device.

Once you have selected the language, country, and connected to a network, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device will start activation. If the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device prompts you for the previous owner’s

Apple ID and password, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device is still linked to an earlier used account. You should go back to the seller and ask them to give you their password. If the previous owner of the Apple device cannot be located or is not present, the seller can try to remove the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device by going to [https://www.icloud.com/find](https://www.icloud.com/find).

![activate iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719308614183.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

Not to be confused with Apple's two-step authentication, the new and more secure two-factor authentication on iCloud introduces push notifications on your iOS device to keep your data safe. With Apple's two unique ways to prove your identity, hackers will find it harder to access your personal and financial data.

Switching to two-factor authentication rather than two-step is becoming more common nowadays as security measures are more advanced. You can always switch your security measure at any point, but remember that two-factor authentication is now an essential way to keep your data safe.

## Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you're wondering how to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud, the answer is no, you can't. However, if you don't have access to your trusted device, you can have a code sent to your trusted phone number via an SMS or an automated phone call to prove to Apple that you own the iCloud account.

If this is impossible, you should request [account recovery](https://iforgot.apple.com/) to regain access to your account.

The easiest way to prevent this issue is by adding another phone number to your Apple ID so you'll always have a backup. Here's how.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, go to **Settings** and tap on your **Apple ID** > **Password & Security**.

**Step 2**: Tap **Edit** and choose to **Add a Trusted Phone Number**. You'll have to enter your device's passcode to continue.
