## Part 1: What is iCloud Activation Lock in iPhone11/12?

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature implemented by Apple on Apple iPhone 14 Plus and other iOS devices. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device by linking it to the owner's Apple ID and iCloud account. When the Activation Lock is enabled, the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device requires the owner's Apple ID and password to set up or restore the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, making it difficult for thieves to use or sell stolen iPhones. The Activation Lock ensures the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device's data remains secure and can only be accessed by the rightful owner.

Regardless of whether you erase your device, Activation Lock can keep on preventing anybody from reactivating your device without your consent. Regardless of whether your device is stolen, the other person will require either your device password or your Apple ID credentials to use the phone. Even if they try resetting your device through DFU mode, they will not have the option to reactivate and utilize it without **Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud unlock**.

However, it can create a problem for you if you're the second owner of this device. So, if you bought this phone from someone else, you must remove the lock first. In such cases, you will need **Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass.**

## Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud Activation Lock?

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature designed to protect iPhones from unauthorized use. However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone 14 Plus locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let's dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.

### Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password

The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 14 Plus and ask for their Apple ID and password. To **bypass Apple iPhone 14 Plus**, you need to have some data in hand:

- Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you're the second owner.
- If a device doesn't have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 14 Plus passcode.

![enter icloud details](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.
- **Step 3:** Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.
- **Step 4:** Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.

However, if you see the Apple iPhone 14 Plus passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device without the iCloud account.

With the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.

### Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely

If the iPhone's first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it's time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.

However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.

So, if it's not a stolen device, you don't need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device and **bypass Apple iPhone 14 Plus** by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.
- **Step 2:** Click the Apple iPhone 14 Plus devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.
- **Step 3:** Pick your Apple iPhone 14 Plus model from there.
- **Step 4:** Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked. It's as simple as that.

### Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device's features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.

**How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?**

A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.

**Limitations of this Features**

When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn't true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.

The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.

- **Step 1:** When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.
- **Step 2.** Click "Proceed" to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect with Wi-Fi, search for the "I" icon near the Wi-Fi tab.
- **Step 3.** Disconnect the Wi-Fi, go to "Connection Settings," and snap "Forget this Network."
- **Step 4.** Click the "I" icon and enter a DNS server IP address. You can browse the IP addresses below:

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-3.jpg)

- USA: 104.154.51.7

- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other regions: 78.100.17.60

- **Step 5.** Presently, click the "Back" choice on the left half of your screen, turn on Wi-Fi, select your network from there, and enter your code.

- **Step 6.** Click "Next Page" and snap "Back" to enter the iCloud bypass screen.

## Conclusion

From the methods mentioned above, it’s easy to see that it only takes a matter of days to unlock the iCloud account or to completely remove the stubborn iCloud lock. The diversity of both methods allows you to easily pick and use the best method that suits your preferences. Regardless of whether you want to download iCloud remover, or you simply want to go for an easy-to-use and pocket-friendly online platform, the fact remains that both of these methods have got you covered.

The iCloud unlocker download method though effective requires a lot of time to go through it and don’t forget the amount of money used to get it working. On the other hand, what I like about our second method is the fact that it's more efficient and easy to use. With it, I don't have to go through the tiring and complex downloading process, since the company itself bypasses the lock and renders My Apple iPhone 14 Plus usable.

## A How-To Guide on Bypassing Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud Activation Lock

iCloud Activation Lock is a feature for Find My iPhone capability. You will need your Apple ID and its code to switch off the "Find My iPhone" feature when it is enabled. You may also need it to erase your data or reactivate and utilize your device. That is to say, iCloud Activation Lock keeps your device from getting into the wrong hands.

Regarding this security plan, if you purchased a second-hand iDevice with "Find My iPhone" enabled, you would be stuck after resetting it without a passcode. Therefore, the best way is to **bypass Apple iPhone 14 Plus** Activation Lock to utilize the phone. You can bypass the lock but can't eliminate the Activation Lock by iTunes.

So, to dispose of the Activation Lock, here, we will provide the best ways possible for **Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass**. All the solutions mentioned here are effective and work almost 100% of the time.

### Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

DNS represents the domain name and is a supportive method for bypassing the Apple iPhone 14 Plus activation lock. It controls the DNS server and redirects the authentication way of your phone. It assists you with the Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass using these steps:

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-se-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

**Step 1.** Go to the Wi-Fi settings and click Configure IP. Then choose Manual and click "Add Server."

**Step 2.** Click on the "i" and enter the DNS server IP according to your area, which is:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
