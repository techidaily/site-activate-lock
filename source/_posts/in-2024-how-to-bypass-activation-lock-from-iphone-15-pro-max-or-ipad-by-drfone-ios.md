\-You need to download the software to enjoy its services.

If you are not the type of person who wants an iCloud remover download to bypass the iCloud lock, simply turn over to the next point where you’ll get the opportunity to know how to bypass the iCloud lock without necessarily using a downloaded software.

## Part 3: Unlock iCloud Lock without Download

The Official iPhone Unlock method happens to be the best unlock iCloud lock method that requires no software whatsoever to bypass the iCloud lock. With this method, all you need is an active internet connection, your unique IMEI number, a valid payment option and your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad make or model. You only need to spend about £19.99 ($27.00) to get your iCloud lock bypassed, unlike in our first method. The waiting period usually varies from one device to another. However, the optimum time falls between 1-3 business days.

### How to bypass iCloud Activation Lock

#### **Step 1:** Visit Official iPhone Unlock Website

Visit [Official iPhoneUnlock website](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) and select "iCloud Unlock".

## Conclusion

From the methods mentioned above, it’s easy to see that it only takes a matter of days to unlock the iCloud account or to completely remove the stubborn iCloud lock. The diversity of both methods allows you to easily pick and use the best method that suits your preferences. Regardless of whether you want to download iCloud remover, or you simply want to go for an easy-to-use and pocket-friendly online platform, the fact remains that both of these methods have got you covered.

The iCloud unlocker download method though effective requires a lot of time to go through it and don’t forget the amount of money used to get it working. On the other hand, what I like about our second method is the fact that it's more efficient and easy to use. With it, I don't have to go through the tiring and complex downloading process, since the company itself bypasses the lock and renders My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max usable.
