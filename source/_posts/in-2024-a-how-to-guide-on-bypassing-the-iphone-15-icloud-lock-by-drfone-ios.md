## Part 1: 4 Efficient Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone 15 iCloud Activation Lock

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner

For an **Apple iPhone 15 iCloud bypass**, you'll require a couple of significant pieces of data:

- Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 15 device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.

![owners apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 15 iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 15.

### 2\. Use DNS Bypass

**What is DNS?**

You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can't utilize the Apple iPhone 15 device.

- **Step 3:** You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.
- **Step 4:** Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:

- USA: 104.154.51.7

- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90

- **Step 5:** After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.

- **Step 4:** The next step is to check if Two-Factor Authentication is enabled on all your iOS devices. If it’s not already on, toggle it on and click **Yes** to proceed with unlocking the Apple ID.
- **Step 5:** Once you’ve confirmed these choices, you’ll see a screen with instructions for entering Recovery Mode on your iDevice. If it doesn’t work, select **Try DFU Mode** in the screen’s bottom-left corner and follow the steps corresponding to your iOS version.
