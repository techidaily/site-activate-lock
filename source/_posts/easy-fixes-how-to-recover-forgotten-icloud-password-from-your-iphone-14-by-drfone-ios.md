These include the likes of disabling Find My Mac, erasing the Apple iPhone 14 device, or using it after a factory reset.

This feature works hand-in-hand with the 'Find My' app. It ensures your data's safety even if your MacBook is lost or stolen. Only the rightful owner can disable **Activation Lock Mac** via their Apple ID. Yet, dealing with this security measure might be challenging for genuine users. This is especially true if they face issues like forgotten passwords or when buying a used device.

The problem of iCloud Activation Lock is not limited to Mac computers. Apple devices such as iPhones and iPads commonly encounter this situation. If you're locked out of your Apple iPhone 14 and can't recall your Apple ID credentials, there's no cause for concern. Wondershare Dr.Fone provides a robust solution to the iCloud Activation Lock issue. You can follow these steps to bypass the iCloud **Mac Activation Lock**:

### Step 1. Commence Unlocking iCloud Activation Lock Using Wondershare Dr.Fone

Install the most recent edition of Wondershare Dr.Fone on your computer and open the application. Proceed to the Toolbox section, then select "Screen Unlock." Follow it by selecting "iOS" to define the Apple iPhone 14 device type. Next, opt for "iCloud Activation Lock Removal" for the intended purpose. Once directed to a new window, click on "Start" to commence the process.

### Step 2. Unlocking iOS Devices: GSM and CDMA Activation Differences

Follow the prompt to connect your iOS device with a USB cable. Identify if your device is GSM or CDMA. After bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device, it will work normally. However, for a CDMA device, calling and other cellular functions won't be available. As you continue unlocking the CDMA device, you'll receive step-by-step instructions. Choose the agreement option and click 'Got It!' to move forward.

### Step 3. Enabling DFU Mode on iOS Devices (Versions 15.0 to 16.3)

Afterward, if your Apple device hasn't undergone jailbreaking, the system will prompt the user to proceed with the process. Guidelines for jailbreaking are available in both written and video formats. For iOS/iPadOS versions 16.4 to 16.6, Dr.Fone is designed to perform the jailbreaking process automatically on your device.

Put iOS devices running versions 15.0 to 16.3 into DFU Mode following the on-screen instructions. After initiating DFU Mode for the first time, the program will command the Apple iPhone 14 device to restart. Click the right arrow to proceed. Repeat the process to enter DFU Mode for the second time. Upon completion, the program will activate and unlock the Apple iPhone 14 device. Once finished, select the "Got It!" button to complete the process.

After confirming your jailbroken iOS device, the process initiates automatically to remove the Activation Lock. Upon completion, a message confirming the finished process will be displayed on the screen. While the Apple iPhone 14 device is in DFU Mode, the computer screen will show the progress of removing the iCloud **Mac Activation Lock**. Keep an eye on the progress bar until it reaches completion. Click the 'Done' button to finish unlocking the Activation Lock.
