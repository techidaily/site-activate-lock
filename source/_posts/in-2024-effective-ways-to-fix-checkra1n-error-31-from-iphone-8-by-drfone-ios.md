It would help if you were careful about the techniques you use to **unlock iCloud-locked iPhone**. There are a lot of companies and software out there that promise results but don’t deliver.

## Part 1: Basic information about iCloud lock

### What Does iCloud Lock Mean?

Part of the normal process of setting up a new iPhone is to register the phone with an Apple ID. Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 8 and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to [bypass the iCloud activation](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html) lock.

### What Does This Mean for You?

If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 8 device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 8 device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone 8 is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.

Now that you know everything you need to know about an iCloud-locked iPhone, read on to find out how to unlock an iCloud-locked iPhone.

## Part 4: How to Unlock iCloud-locked iPhone/iPad/iPod for Free?

If you’re the original user of the iPhone, and you think it’s unfair to shell out extra money to unlock an iPhone that should already be unlocked, then you can visit the Apple Store. You may have forgotten your iCloud details, which include your Apple ID or your password. To get your details back, you can visit the Apple Store and follow the steps to retrieve your details. If you bought an iPhone from a seller, endeavor to ask them if it’s a second-hand iPhone and get the right details from the user.

This might seem like an easy solution. However, it is quite difficult and time-consuming. Apple is extremely difficult about its security. As such, you’ll have to be the original owner of the iPhone, and you’ll need to have all your details if you want to be able to carry out this method. You can try to go about this method, but the chances are strong that you’ll give up soon, in which case you should revisit some methods mentioned earlier.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there are a lot of options with which to **unlock iCloud-locked iPhone/iPad/iPod**. There is a quick method, which is temporary. There is a permanent method, which is easy and safe. Finally, there’s also the free method, but that is extremely complicated.

You can feel free to choose the most suitable method for you, but my recommendation is that you use [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) because in that case, a third party takes over the Apple iPhone 8 SE iCloud bypass and all you have to do is wait a while.

## How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 8

Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 8 by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8.

In this article, I'm going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 8 from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone 8"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.

## Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone

You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8 device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8 and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 8.

#### **Step 1:** Download the Software

Visit the following website [http://en.pangu.io/](http://en.pangu.io/) and click on the "Download and Help" tab. A new page with the download option will open up. The entire download is about 21MB in size. With the file downloaded, install the program on your Mac and launch it. Its interface looks like the screenshot below.

![how to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736110927930.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Connect iDevice

Switch OFF the "Find My Apple iPhone 8" feature and switch ON the "Aeroplane Mode." Connect your Apple iPhone 8 to your Mac using its USB cable and click on the "Start Jailbreak" tab to initiate the jailbreaking process.

#### **Step 3:** Confirmation

A new interface with a screen notification will open up. Carefully read the three steps before proceeding. If you are okay with the information, click on the "Already did" icon. The jailbreaking process will begin from this point.

![start to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736112213161.jpg)

#### **Step 4:** Jailbreak Complete

Your iPhone will reboot a number of times, which is normal. Once the process is done, you will get a "Jailbreak Succeeded" message and the Cydia icon display on your iDevice. Unplug your Apple iPhone 8 and turn ON the "Find My Apple iPhone 8" feature. Set up your Apple iPhone 8 using your new preferred details.

## Part 4: Bypass iCloud Activation Lock offline with few clicks
