### 1\. What is Find My?

For instance, when Find My iPhone is initiated, you can see where your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max is. You might use it to show your location to others or play a sound on your lost device, making it easier to find.

To utilize this feature, you need to initiate this feature on your device and utilize a PC or another phone to find, reset or lock your lost iPhone. If you're selling your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or gifting it to someone else, you should first switch off the Find My feature.

### 2\. How to turn off Find My?

If you want to reset your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max to erase every one of the data and return it to its default condition, Apple expects you to switch off Find My in advance. Also, experts at the Apple store frequently expect you to switch it off before they can repair it.

Switching it off will not erase any of your data, so you don't have to stress over that. It'll simply make it difficult to track down your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max on a map when lost.

The best way to switch off the Find My feature is very direct. The following steps will tell you how to make it happen:

- Open the Settings of your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max and tap your name or profile.
- Explore the "Find My" option and go for "Find My iPhone."
- If the Find My iPhone feature is initiated, the toggle button on top of the page should be green. Switch the "Find My iPhone" toggle key to turn it off.
- Enter your Apple ID details.
- Affirm your activity, and that's all you need to turn this feature off.

### 3\. Can I bypass iOS Devices like iPad or iPods?

## Part 2: FAQs

### 1\. Why do we need to bypass the iCloud activation lock?

iCloud is software that secures your backups, photos, and passcodes, allows access to Apple's credentials, and much more. iCloud activation lock is one of the features of 'Find Phone' that secures your device's personal information from falling into the wrong hands.

However, it can be trouble if you buy a second-hand iOS device. It can be difficult to access iCloud if the previous one has enabled activation lock. That's why you need to bypass iOS 17, so you can access all the applications and secure all backups.

### 2\. Is it legal to bypass the iCloud activation lock?

Bypassing the iCloud activation lock with or without the previous owner is legal. There are no illegal ways to unlock it. The steps and tools are all legal and safe to bypass the iOS 17 iCloud activation lock. Without bypassing the activation lock, you won't be able to use your iOS device freely or at all.

### 3\. What will happen after a successful bypass?

The data you previously had on your iOS device will be permanently erased as soon as iOS 17 has been bypassed. Additionally, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device will be set up as a new one. After finishing the bypass, you can now enter all your details and start using the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device. Furthermore, you can back up all your data easily as the previous one has been deleted.
