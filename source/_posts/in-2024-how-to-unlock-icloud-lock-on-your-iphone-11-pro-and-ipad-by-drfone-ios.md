## How to Unlock iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro and iPad?

## Part 1: Is it possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone

At the start of 2014, apple introduced what they call "iCloud Activation Lock". This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don't have the credentials using third-party software.

![bypass activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/bypass-activation-lock.jpg)

## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 11 Pro or iPad?

This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery. Without access to the owner’s Apple ID and/or password, accessing the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device becomes impossible. Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.

This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 11 Pro option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 11 Pro. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 11 Pro or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.

## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 11 Pro or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

Using a valid Apple ID and password is the easiest way to bypass the activation lock on Apple iPhone 11 Pro or iPad Mini. In any case, if you legitimately purchased the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device from the previous owner, they should have no qualms giving you these details. If it’s a new device, and you are the original owner, you will have this information ready to use for activation. Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 11 Pro or iPad Mini.

![add apple id password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/add-apple-id-password.jpg)

- **Step 1.** Have the previous owner enter their details on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro or iPad Mini, or request them to send the same to you.

- **Step 3.** Within a few minutes, the home screen should appear on the Apple iPhone 11 Pro or iPad.

_**A note for users before we proceed with the bypass steps:**  
Users on iOS 12 or earlier can locate this option on settings, navigating to iCloud, then signing out. For iOS 13 or later, click on settings, then your name, and sign out._

- **Step 5.** Chances are, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro or iPad will prompt you to enter the original user’s ID and Password. Simply enter the details available to you.
- **Step 6.** Finally, the best part of the unlocking process; navigate to the settings tab to erase all data. Open up settings, click reset and proceed to erase all content, including settings.
- **Step 7.** At this point, your Apple iPhone 11 Pro or iPad will restart/reboot, allowing you to set up the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device anew.

There are a few web-based resources and tricks that facilitate this procedure. Suffice to say, these methods, known as Jailbreaking, do not work when activation lock is enabled.
