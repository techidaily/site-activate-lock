## How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and iPad

There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.

With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.

## Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple

In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.

#### **Step 1:** Enter your Login Details

To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.

#### **Step 2:** Find My iPhone

Once you have gained access to your device, locate the "Find My iPhone" option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It's also the main reason why you can't access your iCloud account.

#### **Step 3:** Restore your Device

With the "Find My iPhone" option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings> General> Reset> Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.

#### **Step 4:** Sign In

With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.

## Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner

Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device happens to be the real owner, then he/she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.

This approach, however, has a downside. It's only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.

### Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner

The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To **bypass iPad 3** activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.

However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.

**Step 2.** On your iPad, go to the "Settings" application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.

- If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to "iCloud" and sign out.
- If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click "Sign Out."

### Can I remove the activation lock by hard reset?

A hard reset doesn't remove the activation lock from the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. For instance, if a phone is hard reset with the Google account signed in, the phone will, in any case, request you to enter the account credentials once turned back on.

### How to remove the activation lock when I have my Apple ID and password?

You can unlock your device the same way as the previous owner would do remotely, as stated above. So, when you have the iCloud account credentials, you can follow our steps, and your iPad will unlock.

## Conclusion

Many reasons can compel you to bypass iPad activation Lock without a past user. This article discusses how to remove the iPad activation lock with the assistance of iCloud or settings from iDevices. However, if you don't have the Mac ID credentials of your iPad, you will require help from a third-party tool that can bypass iPad activation lock.

## Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you're wondering how to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud, the answer is no, you can't. However, if you don't have access to your trusted device, you can have a code sent to your trusted phone number via an SMS or an automated phone call to prove to Apple that you own the iCloud account.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, go to **Settings** and tap on your **Apple ID** > **Password & Security**.

**Step 2**: Tap **Edit** and choose to **Add a Trusted Phone Number**. You'll have to enter your device's passcode to continue.
