**Step 2: Jailbreak and Confirm Device Information**

Now jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6, and once it is done, a warning message will appear on the screen. You need to “Tick” the confirmation statement that you agree with the terms and conditions and click on the “Next” button. You are also required to confirm the information, like the Apple iPhone 6 device model.
