## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

Using a valid Apple ID and password is the easiest way to bypass the activation lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini. In any case, if you legitimately purchased the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device from the previous owner, they should have no qualms giving you these details. If it’s a new device, and you are the original owner, you will have this information ready to use for activation. Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini.

- **Step 1.** Have the previous owner enter their details on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini, or request them to send the same to you.
- **Step 2.** Fire up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and when prompted on the Activation Lock Screen, enter the Apple ID and password.
- **Step 3.** Within a few minutes, the home screen should appear on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad.

_**A note for users before we proceed with the bypass steps:**

- **Step 5.** Chances are, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad will prompt you to enter the original user’s ID and Password. Simply enter the details available to you.
- **Step 6.** Finally, the best part of the unlocking process; navigate to the settings tab to erase all data. Open up settings, click reset and proceed to erase all content, including settings.
- **Step 7.** At this point, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad will restart/reboot, allowing you to set up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device anew.

There are a few web-based resources and tricks that facilitate this procedure. Suffice to say, these methods, known as Jailbreaking, do not work when activation lock is enabled. Stick to using credible methods like the one listed above. Alternatively, you can use iCloud to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini activation lock.
