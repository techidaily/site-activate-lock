#### 3\. A Loophole: DNS Bypass

Most iPhones today run on the latest iOS versions. However, if the user has an iPhone running on an older version of the operating system, the DNS method can be used to bypass the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device activation lock. This technique uses a loophole in the Wi-Fi DNS settings on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. It tricks the Apple iPhone 14 Pro into thinking that it is unlocked.

Listed below are the steps to be followed to remove the "Find My iPhone" activation lock in the absence of the previous iPhone user.

**Step 1:** Start by setting up the Apple iPhone 14 Pro as a new device. The user must wait until they reach the Wi-Fi settings page.

**Step 2:** On opening the Wi-Fi screen, connect to a strong Wi-Fi network. Next to the chosen network name, tap on the "I" icon available on the right-hand side.

- Asia – 104.155.220.58
- Europe – 104.155.28.90
- Australia and Oceania – 35.189.47.23
- North America – 104.154.51.7
- South America – 35.199.88.219

This must get the Apple iPhone 14 Pro unlocked by now.

#### 4\. The Official Approach - Apple Support

### **Scenario 2: If you can get in touch with the previous owner**

#### 1\. Apple Activation Lock Removal with Screen Passcode

This situation is possible if the new owner can physically contact the original owner of the iPhone. Ask the Apple iPhone 14 Pro owner to enter their screen passcode and unlock the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. Exit the used Apple ID and remove the **apple activation lock** upon opening it.

#### 2\. Ask to Remotely perform iCloud Unlock through iCloud.com

At times, the previous owner may not be physically resent near the new iPhone owner. In that scenario, having the person's contact information may come in handy. Next, ask the person to remove their device from iCloud. It may be done remotely by following the steps mentioned below.

**Step 1:** Make use of their Apple ID and passcode to sign in to the iCloud website. Or ask the owner to do so.

**Step 2:** The user needs to click on the "Find My" button. Next, select the Apple iPhone 14 Pro devices to form the "All Devices" menu.

**Step 3:** Click on "Erase Device" from the available options appearing on the screen, click on "Erase Device". Now follow the steps to erase all data and settings on the respective device.

**Step 4:** Choose "Remove from Account". Finish setting up the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, and the new user will start using it normally.
