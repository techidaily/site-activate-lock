### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![check IMEI code on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg)

**Method 2:** Click the "Device" icon in iTunes to access the "Summary" tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, tap "Phone Number" under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device model.

**Method 3:** For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you're on the “General” tab, then select "Phone Number" below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13/.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.

If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.

## Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?
