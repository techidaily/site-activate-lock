## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

#### 2\. Online Activation Lock Bypassing Service

Several online services are available that claim to remove activation lock from iPhone. Some of these services are available at absolutely no cost.

There is no need to download any additional tools and programs or hardware for this purpose. Getting started with an activation lock online bypassing service is straightforward.

**Step 1:** Begin by entering the details of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro model.

#### 3\. A Loophole: DNS Bypass

Most iPhones today run on the latest iOS versions. However, if the user has an iPhone running on an older version of the operating system, the DNS method can be used to bypass the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device activation lock. This technique uses a loophole in the Wi-Fi DNS settings on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. It tricks the Apple iPhone 14 Pro into thinking that it is unlocked.

Listed below are the steps to be followed to remove the "Find My iPhone" activation lock in the absence of the previous iPhone user.

**Step 1:** Start by setting up the Apple iPhone 14 Pro as a new device. The user must wait until they reach the Wi-Fi settings page.

**Step 2:** On opening the Wi-Fi screen, connect to a strong Wi-Fi network. Next to the chosen network name, tap on the "I" icon available on the right-hand side.

![bypass apple activation lock 10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/dns-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** The next step is to choose the manual option available at the top of the page and use one of the DNS values mentioned below.

![bypass apple activation lock 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/dns-3.jpg)

- Asia – 104.155.220.58
- Europe – 104.155.28.90
- Australia and Oceania – 35.189.47.23
- North America – 104.154.51.7
- South America – 35.199.88.219

This must get the Apple iPhone 14 Pro unlocked by now.
