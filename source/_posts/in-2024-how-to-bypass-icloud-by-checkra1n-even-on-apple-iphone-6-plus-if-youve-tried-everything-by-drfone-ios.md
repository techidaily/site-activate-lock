## How To Bypass iCloud By Checkra1n Even On Apple iPhone 6 Plus If You've Tried Everything

Since iOS 12.3, Apple has been using its new Activation Lock feature to deter theft. This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.

While this is a welcomed addition for those looking to protect their device, it can also be a major inconvenience for those who have lost or forgotten their iCloud password. Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information. You will learn in this post how to use Checkra1n iCloud bypass to unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: What is Checkra1n?

Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.

Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don't know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.

Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don't know the passcode.

**Pros**

- The tool doesn't require tech skills
- It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices
- Supports a wide range of hardware platforms
- It is not possible to exploit remotely

**Cons**

- Jailbreaking older devices is limited
- A reboot won't save them

## Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?

You may consider using Checkra1n if you are looking for a method to bypass the iCloud activation lock. You can remove the iCloud activation lock from your Apple iPhone 6 Plus or iPad using this method.

### 1\. How to Jailbreak an iOS Device with Checkra1n?

![checkra1n icloud bypass ios 15](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/checkra1n-icloud-bypass-4.png)

### 2\. How to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with Checkra1n?

The next step is to figure out how to bypass iCloud with Checkra1n iCloud Bypass. We will show you how to use the method on a Mac. The Checkra1n installation process has a few technical aspects, but if you follow the steps, you shouldn't have any problem.

**Step 2.** Using the Terminal app, install brew and usbmuxd by entering the following commands:

- /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install…>)"
- brew install usbmuxd

**Step 3.** Launch Checkra1n once those have been installed.

**Step 4.** Follow the instructions to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6 Plus by connecting it to your computer.

**Step 5.** The following command will create a tunnel from Port 2222 to Port 44 (or 22 if this fails) using USBmuxd's built-in iProxy tool:

- iproxy 2222 44

**Step 6.** Enter the following command in a new Terminal window by pressing Command + T:

- ssh root@localhost -p 2222

**Step 7.** To move the setup file and patch the system, enter the following commands:

- mount -o rw,union,update /
- mv /Applications/Setup.app /Applications/Setup.bak
- rm -rf /Applications/Setup.app

**Step 8.** Lastly, enter these two commands to clear any springboard processes and clear the setup file's cache:

- uicache -all
- Killall backboardd

Checkra1n will bypass the iCloud Activation Lock after you enter the last command.

## 3 Easy Methods to Unlock iCloud Locked Apple iPhone 6 Plus/iPad/iPod

You bought a second-hand iPhone for less than half the market value, and you were really happy about your purchase. But then you try to operate it, and you are asked for an Apple ID and password.

Can you identify with the above-given situation? It doesn't have to be exactly like that, maybe you were given an iPhone as a gift by someone, or maybe you just accidentally got **your iPhone iCloud locked**. If your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is locked, your primary concern should be how to **bypass the activation lock on an iPhone**, like the Apple iPhone 6 Plus SE. It would help if you were careful about the techniques you use to **unlock iCloud-locked iPhone**. There are a lot of companies and software out there that promise results but don’t deliver.

## Part 1: Basic information about iCloud lock

### What Does iCloud Lock Mean?

Part of the normal process of setting up a new iPhone is to register the phone with an Apple ID. Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 6 Plus and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to [bypass the iCloud activation](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html) lock.

### What Does This Mean for You?

If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone 6 Plus is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.

Now that you know everything you need to know about an iCloud-locked iPhone, read on to find out how to unlock an iCloud-locked iPhone.

Once the Apple iPhone 6 Plus SE iCloud bypass is complete, you’ll get a message saying, “You have successfully connected to my Server”. Now you have successfully been able to unlock iCloud locked iPhone. However, you should know that while this is a quick-fix solution, it isn’t a permanent one. If you want a permanent means by which to unlock iCloud locked iPhone, read the next part.

## Part 4: How to Unlock iCloud-locked iPhone/iPad/iPod for Free?

If you’re the original user of the iPhone, and you think it’s unfair to shell out extra money to unlock an iPhone that should already be unlocked, then you can visit the Apple Store. You may have forgotten your iCloud details, which include your Apple ID or your password. To get your details back, you can visit the Apple Store and follow the steps to retrieve your details. If you bought an iPhone from a seller, endeavor to ask them if it’s a second-hand iPhone and get the right details from the user.

This might seem like an easy solution. However, it is quite difficult and time-consuming. Apple is extremely difficult about its security. As such, you’ll have to be the original owner of the iPhone, and you’ll need to have all your details if you want to be able to carry out this method. You can try to go about this method, but the chances are strong that you’ll give up soon, in which case you should revisit some methods mentioned earlier.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there are a lot of options with which to **unlock iCloud-locked iPhone/iPad/iPod**. There is a quick method, which is temporary. There is a permanent method, which is easy and safe. Finally, there’s also the free method, but that is extremely complicated.

You can feel free to choose the most suitable method for you, but my recommendation is that you use [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) because in that case, a third party takes over the Apple iPhone 6 Plus SE iCloud bypass and all you have to do is wait a while.
