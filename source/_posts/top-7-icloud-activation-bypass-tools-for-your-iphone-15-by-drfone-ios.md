## How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 15

Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 15 by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15.

In this article, I'm going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 15 from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone 15"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.

## Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone

You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15 and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 15.

#### **Step 1:** Download the Software

Visit the following website [http://en.pangu.io/](http://en.pangu.io/) and click on the "Download and Help" tab. A new page with the download option will open up. The entire download is about 21MB in size. With the file downloaded, install the program on your Mac and launch it. Its interface looks like the screenshot below.

![how to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736110927930.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Connect iDevice

#### **Step 3:** Confirmation

A new interface with a screen notification will open up. Carefully read the three steps before proceeding. If you are okay with the information, click on the "Already did" icon. The jailbreaking process will begin from this point.

#### **Step 4:** Jailbreak Complete

Unplug your Apple iPhone 15 and turn ON the "Find My Apple iPhone 15" feature. Set up your Apple iPhone 15 using your new preferred details.

## How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 15 and iPad

There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.

With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.

## Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple

In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.

#### **Step 1:** Enter your Login Details

To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.

#### **Step 2:** Find My iPhone

Once you have gained access to your device, locate the "Find My iPhone" option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It's also the main reason why you can't access your iCloud account.

#### **Step 3:** Restore your Device

With the "Find My iPhone" option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings> General> Reset> Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.

#### **Step 4:** Sign In

With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.

## Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner

Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 15 device happens to be the real owner, then he/she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.

This approach, however, has a downside. It's only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.

## Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock

One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the [Official iPhoneUnlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare). With the help of the iCloud Activation Lock Removal process, you can easily bypass the iCloud Activation Lock and remove it completely from your device. The following is a detailed process on how you can seamlessly do it with the peace of mind that your data and all valuable information will be kept in place.

#### **Step 1:** Purchase the Service

For you to unlock the iCloud lock, using this method, you first have to obtain the rights to do so. Securing these rights is simply done by purchasing their services. The price at which you’ll be charged will depend on the model of your device. To buy these services, visit [the webiste](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) of Official iPhoneUnlock and select "iCloud Unlock" to its "iCloud Unlock/Activation Lock Removal" feature, then enter your IMEI number from the drop-down list as illustrated below. Once you have located your phone make or model, click on the "Add to Cart" tab. The price at which you are going to be charged will be displayed on your right-hand side.

![fix icloud lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719794951413.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Enter your Email Address

A new page with your purchase details as shown below will open up. Enter your email address as requested and click on the "Continue" button. Make sure that you have entered the correct email address as it will be used to inform you that your iCloud lock is no longer active.

![how to fix icloud lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719796268564.jpg)

#### **Step 3:** Pay Options

Once you have entered your email address, a new interface requesting you to choose your preferred payment method will be displayed. Choose your best-preferred method by clicking on the "Pay with Credit or Debit Card" tab and enter your bank details. Once you submit your payment, your iCloud lock will be unlocked after a period of between 2-3 days. A confirmation email will be sent to your designated email address.
