## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 6s Plus or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

Using a valid Apple ID and password is the easiest way to bypass the activation lock on Apple iPhone 6s Plus or iPad Mini.

Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 6s Plus or iPad Mini.

![add apple id password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/add-apple-id-password.jpg)

- **Step 5.** Chances are, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus or iPad will prompt you to enter the original user’s ID and Password. Simply enter the details available to you.
- **Step 6.** Finally, the best part of the unlocking process; navigate to the settings tab to erase all data. Open up settings, click reset and proceed to erase all content, including settings.

## 3 Effective Ways to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 6s Plus

Ever since the launch of the first iPhone, both iPhone and Apple have seen tremendous growth year after year on account of the new features and capabilities Apple continues to add to the iPhone. Apple has placed the Apple iPhone 6s Plus as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.

Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus. We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.

## Part 1: Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone 6s Plus gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.

## Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 6s Plus)
