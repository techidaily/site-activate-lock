## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone X device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone X device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone X device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13/.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.

If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.

## Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?

## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone X device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone X device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don't have the credentials using third-party software.

## Part 3: How to Free Unlock the iCloud Lock on iPhone

Since your Apple iPhone X is locked, you will not be able to access files until you unlock iCloud on your Apple device. One way to unlock iCloud locked phone is to bypass the iCloud activation lock by following the steps below

Step 1. Take your Apple iPhone X and while on the "Activate iPhone" screen, press the home button and then press the "Wi-Fi" settings. Next to the "Wi-Fi" symbol, tap on "i". Now you need to change the existing DNS settings. The DNS settings you need to type are as follows:

1. If you are in the USA type in 104.154.51.7
2. In Europe, type 104.155.28.90
3. In Asia, type 104.155.220.58
4. The rest of the world, please type in 78.109.17.60

Step 2. Tap on the "Back" button then click "Done". Next, click "Activation help". Once you have done that, you will see a message that says: You have successfully connected to my server." If you tap on the menu, you will be able to access different iCloud services such as iCloud Locked User Chat, Mail, Social, Maps, Video, YouTube, Audia, and games, among others.

## Part 4: How to unlock iCloud lock by Apple iPhone Unlock

Sometimes it may not be possible to completely unlock your iCloud Lock. For instance, the free method of unlocking your iCloud Lock only works on iOS 9 and iOS 8 for iPhones. Anything else will not work properly. Moreover, you may not be able to know how to unlock iCloud lock-free if you are in certain countries. That is when you can think of using the Official iPhone Unlock service which will completely unlock your Apple iPhone X without any hassle. The iCloud Activation Lock Removal tool will quickly remove the iCloud activation lock from the previous owner's account. In short, this is an easy and seamless tool for removing the iCloud lock to set your own.

Step 1 - Visit the [Apple iPhone unlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) by clicking on this link.

Step 2 - Enter the IMEI/Serial number of your device and send it.

![Enter your IMEI/Serial number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14720745007162.jpg)

Step 3 - Just wait for a confirmation message telling you that the iCloud Lock has been removed.

Step 4 - Now create a new iCloud account and start using your device

This tool works on all iPhone 6, 6+, 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4, and iPad 4, 3, 2 Air 2 and also works on iOS, and it doesn't matter why you are unlocking it from.
