These include the likes of disabling Find My Mac, erasing the Apple iPhone 11 device, or using it after a factory reset.

This feature works hand-in-hand with the 'Find My' app. It ensures your data's safety even if your MacBook is lost or stolen. Only the rightful owner can disable **Activation Lock Mac** via their Apple ID. Yet, dealing with this security measure might be challenging for genuine users. This is especially true if they face issues like forgotten passwords or when buying a used device.

Below, we'll go through various methods for how to bypass iCloud **Activation Lock on Mac**:

### Fix 1. Retrieve Your Password

Forgetting the Apple ID password can often lead to being locked out of your own device due to the iCloud Activation Lock.

Apple offers a mechanism to reset forgotten passwords via the Apple ID account recovery process.

Visit the [Apple ID account page](https://appleid.apple.com/sign-in) through a web browser on any device.

Follow these steps to bypass the **Mac Activation Lock**:

**Step 1.** Utilize a different Apple device, like an iPhone, iPad, or another Mac, that is currently signed in with the identical Apple ID. From there, navigate to the [iCloud website](https://www.icloud.com/) and sign in using your Apple account credentials.
