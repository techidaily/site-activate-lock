## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 7 device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 7 device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 7 device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

## Part 2: What is Find My?

By all accounts, Apple's Find My feature does what it says. If you lose your Apple iPhone 7, you can recognize its latest area using the iCloud Site, and you can make it play a sound.

Yet, Find My iPhone does substantially more! You can utilize it to find a missing Macintosh, iPad, iPod, and even AirPods. It also safeguards your data on the off chance a gadget is stolen. It even works with Family Sharing to find phones claimed by anybody in your family.

## Part 3: How to Disable Find My?

When you switch off Find My feature on your iDevice, the Activation Lock is naturally switched off. Here's how:

- Go to Settings, click on your account (your account name) and click the "Find My" option on your iDevice.
