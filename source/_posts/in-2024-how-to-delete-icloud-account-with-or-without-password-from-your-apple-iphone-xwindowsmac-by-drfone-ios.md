Understanding the iCloud Activation Lock is essential when purchasing a used Apple device. This security feature, designed by Apple, is activated when ‘Find My iPhone’ is enabled. It links the Apple iPhone X device to the owner’s Apple ID, preventing others from activating it without the owner’s permission. This lock is crucial for preventing unauthorized use of lost or stolen devices.

Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, **checking the iCloud Activation Lock status** is important. Here’s how:

- **Step 1:** Power on the Apple iPhone X device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone X device has been properly erased.

![iphone lockscreen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg)

****Note:**** **If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone X device still needs to be fully erased. In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone X device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.**

- **Step 2:** Start setting up the Apple iPhone X device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone X device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.
- **Step 3:** During the setup, if the Apple iPhone X device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone X device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone X device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.

If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an **activation lock check** when buying second-hand phones.

## Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices

If you’re planning to sell your Apple iPhone X or are curious about the status of a lost phone, you should also perform an **iCloud lock check**. This feature, crucial for security, can prevent a new user from accessing the phone without your permission. Here’s how you can check the status:

### Method 1: Check Within the Phone

The first way to check your devices’ iCloud activation lock status is through the Apple iPhone X devices themselves. There are two ways to do this, as presented in this section.

#### Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App

First, open Settings on your iDevice. At the top of its menu, tap on your profile name.

If you see an iCloud account listed here and you’re signed in, your device is still linked to that iCloud account. Thus, it will still be under the iCloud Activation Lock. If there is no iCloud activation lock, it should look like this:

![iphone no icloud lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-03.jpg)

#### Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation

If you are setting up the phone afresh or after a factory reset, proceed with the initial setup steps. Suppose the Apple iPhone X device asks for an Apple ID and password previously associated with the Apple iPhone X device at any point during the setup. In that case, it indicates that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active. This occurs if the Apple iPhone X device was not correctly erased before the reset.

### Method 2: Using IMEI Number

Every iPhone or iPad has its own IMEI number. It can be used to check details about the Apple iPhone X device remotely, including **checking the iCloud Activation Lock**. Here are the steps to use your IMEI number to **check the iCloud Activation Lock status** of your phone using third-party apps:

- **Step 1:** Open your **Settings** app on the iDevice.
- **Step 2:** Go to **General**, then choose **About.**
- **Step 3:** Find the **IMEI** number by scrolling down. It’s a 15-digit number that’s unique to your device.

![imei page iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-04.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Several third-party websites offer services to check iCloud Activation Lock status using the IMEI number. Some of these services are free, while others might charge a small fee. Make sure to use a reputable service to avoid scams.
- **Step 5:** On the chosen service’s website, enter your device’s IMEI number.
- **Step 6:** The service will provide details regarding the iCloud activation lock status.

Remember, if selling, always erase your device and sign out of iCloud to remove the activation lock. For buyers, always ensure your device is free from previous iCloud accounts.

## Part 3: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

If you discover that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active on your iOS device, removing it is crucial, especially if you plan to sell or repurpose it. There are a few methods to do this, depending on whether you have physical access to the phone.

### Method 1: Removing Apple ID Through Apple’s Means

The simplest way to remove the iCloud activation lock is by [<u>removing the Apple ID from the phone</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html). You can do these in two ways, as will be outlined below:

#### Method 1.1 Removing Apple ID When You Have the Apple iPhone X device With You

When you have the iDevice with you, it’s easy to remove the Apple ID. Just follow the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Launch the **Settings** app on your device.
- **Step 2:** Tap on your profile at the top of the app.
- **Step 3:** Tap on **iCloud.**
- **Step 4:** Find the **Sign Out** button. You’ll be prompted to enter your Apple ID password. After which, turn off your **Find My** by following the on-screen instructions.

#### Method 1.2. Removing Apple ID When You Don’t Have the Apple iPhone X device

Apple also provides a remote way to remove a device from your Apple ID. Here’s how:

- **Step 1:** Go to [<u>www.iCloud.com/find</u>](https://www.icloud.com/find).

![icloud find my page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-05.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Log in with your Apple ID, email address, phone number, and password.
- **Step 3:** Choose the one you want to remove from the list of devices.
- **Step 4:** Follow the prompts to remove the Apple iPhone X device from your iCloud account.

### Method 2: Remove iCloud With Dr.Fone
