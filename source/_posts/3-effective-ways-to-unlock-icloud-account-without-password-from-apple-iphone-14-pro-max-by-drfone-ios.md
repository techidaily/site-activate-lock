Well, if you just bought your phone from eBay, a second-hand vendor, or a friend, the chances are that its iCloud account is locked; that is, the new user will not able able to use it unless you know the username and password of the previous owner.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQckthGQm-8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

## Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max has an iCloud account lock on it?

If your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.

At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as [iCloud Activation Lock](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html). What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device's files, features, and functions.

This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy [a second-hand iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html) from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.

It doesn't matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max. Whether you [jailbreak](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html) it, [reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html) it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.

If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

![jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg)

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

- If you are not the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device owner, this method is not useful.

### Method 2: Use iCloud DNS Bypass

The Domain Name System (DNS) transmits readable domains (names) into numerical IP addresses. Whereas [iCloud DNS Bypass](http://iclouddnsbypass.com/) means we are bypassing the Activation Lock on iCloud by manipulating the DNS activation path, DNS server, and namely. You apply this method for iPhone Activation Lock removal by following the mentioned steps below:

**Step 1:** After switching on your device, select your “Country” and “Language” from the menu. Now, enter the settings page of WI-FI, tap on “Proceed” and look for the symbol “i” whenever you are asked to connect to the Wi-Fi.

**Step 2:** At that point, disconnect the internet connection and open the "Connection Settings," then tap on the "Forget this network" choice. Now hit the “i” to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock and for this, enter a DNS server IP address. You can select one of them from the given list with respect to your location:

- For Europe, it is: 104.155.28.90
- For Asia, it is: 104.155.220.58
- For the USA, it is: 104.154.51.7
- For Australia and Oceania, it is: 35.189.47.23
- For South America, it is: 35.199.88.219
- For Europe, it is: 104.155.28.90
- And for other continents, it should be: 78.100.17.60
