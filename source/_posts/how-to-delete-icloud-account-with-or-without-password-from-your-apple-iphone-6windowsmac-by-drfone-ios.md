In case the above methods seem improper for your query, so you don't have a lot of options left for you. Simply pick up your phone and contact [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/); however, you should be the real owner of your device. Otherwise, they won't let you do anything. You need to give them proof that you are the real owner by providing them with the Apple iPhone 6 device's MEID, serial number, and IMEI.
