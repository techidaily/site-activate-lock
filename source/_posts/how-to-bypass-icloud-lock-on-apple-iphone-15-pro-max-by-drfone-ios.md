It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.

## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

If it’s a new device, and you are the original owner, you will have this information ready to use for activation. Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad Mini.

- **Step 3.** Within a few minutes, the home screen should appear on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad.

- **Step 5.** Chances are, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max or iPad will prompt you to enter the original user’s ID and Password. Simply enter the details available to you.
- **Step 6.** Finally, the best part of the unlocking process; navigate to the settings tab to erase all data. Open up settings, click reset and proceed to erase all content, including settings.
