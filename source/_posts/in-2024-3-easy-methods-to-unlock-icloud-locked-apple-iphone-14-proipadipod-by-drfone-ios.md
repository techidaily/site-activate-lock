## Part 1: Basic information about iCloud lock

### What Does iCloud Lock Mean?

Part of the normal process of setting up a new iPhone is to register the phone with an Apple ID. Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to [bypass the iCloud activation](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html) lock.

### What Does This Mean for You?

If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone 14 Pro is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.

Now that you know everything you need to know about an iCloud-locked iPhone, read on to find out how to unlock an iCloud-locked iPhone.

## Part 4: How to Unlock iCloud-locked iPhone/iPad/iPod for Free?

If you’re the original user of the iPhone, and you think it’s unfair to shell out extra money to unlock an iPhone that should already be unlocked, then you can visit the Apple Store.

If you bought an iPhone from a seller, endeavor to ask them if it’s a second-hand iPhone and get the right details from the user.

This might seem like an easy solution. However, it is quite difficult and time-consuming. Apple is extremely difficult about its security. As such, you’ll have to be the original owner of the iPhone, and you’ll need to have all your details if you want to be able to carry out this method. You can try to go about this method, but the chances are strong that you’ll give up soon, in which case you should revisit some methods mentioned earlier.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there are a lot of options with which to **unlock iCloud-locked iPhone/iPad/iPod**. There is a quick method, which is temporary. There is a permanent method, which is easy and safe. Finally, there’s also the free method, but that is extremely complicated.

You can feel free to choose the most suitable method for you, but my recommendation is that you use [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) because in that case, a third party takes over the Apple iPhone 14 Pro SE iCloud bypass and all you have to do is wait a while.

## Part 1: Basic knowledge about iCloud activation lock

### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost. Your Apple iPhone 14 Pro should be iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6S, or 6S + to have the services of the iCloud activation lock. For phones on iOS 7 and above versions, the activation lock is auto-enabled once the Apple iPhone 14 Pro is switched on.

### What is the iCloud activation lock used for?

An iCloud lock is basically for the security of an individual’s phone to not misuse and your details are safe. Once the 'Find My iPhone’ feature is enabled on your Apple devices, Apple’s activation server saves your Apple Id. Henceforth whenever your phone is turned off or performs any type of action such as erasing the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device or reactivating the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, then your device will ask for unlocking iCloud activation.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone 14 Pro was iCloud activation locked?

If you are purchasing an iPhone or any other Apple device from someone, you need to make sure that the Apple device is no longer linked to the prior owner's account. To make sure you are on the safe side, you could check it for yourself. There are two ways to check:

1\. You can visit [https://icloud.com/activationlock](https://icloud.com/activationlock) from any Computer or MAC to check the present Activation Lock status of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device.

2\. Follow the steps below to be sure that you can use your Apple iPhone 14 Pro device hassle-free:

1) Switch on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device and slide to unlock it.

If the screen displays a passcode lock screen or you can see the Home Screen, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you have purchased has not been erased. The seller will go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Ensure the seller clears the phone before he hands it over to you for use.

![erase all content and settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719307921421.jpg)

2) Set up your device.

Once you have selected the language, country, and connected to a network, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device will start activation. If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device prompts you for the previous owner’s

Apple ID and password, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is still linked to an earlier used account. You should go back to the seller and ask them to give you their password. If the previous owner of the Apple device cannot be located or is not present, the seller can try to remove the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device by going to [https://www.icloud.com/find](https://www.icloud.com/find).

![activate iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719308614183.jpg)

Once this is done, and your device prompts you for 'Set up our iPhone/iPad/iPod’ as you turn it on, then you know your device is ready for use.

![set up our iphone/ipad/ipod](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719307661722.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device to a specific Apple ID.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods.

Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. If the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to **Settings >** Tap on the profile on top of the app > **Sign Out**.
