## How to Unlock iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and iPad?

## Part 1: Is it possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone

At the start of 2014, apple introduced what they call "iCloud Activation Lock". This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don't have the credentials using third-party software.
