## How to Unlock iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and iPad?

## Part 1: Is it possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone

The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don't have the credentials using third-party software.

The iCloud DNS Bypass can assist you if you forget your login information (Apple ID or password) or purchase a used device with an iCloud lock activated. It is a free approach to unlocking iCloud.

The readable names are transformed into numerical IP addresses via the Domain Name System (DNS). To launch the program, it makes use of a DNS server that serves as a host.
