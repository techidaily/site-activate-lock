Nowadays, many purchase a used iPhone instead of a fresh, out-of-the-box new one. Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.

It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials.

However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here's how:
