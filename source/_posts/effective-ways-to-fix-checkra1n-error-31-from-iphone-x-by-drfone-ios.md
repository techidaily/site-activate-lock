To get past two-factor authentication on iCloud, Go to **Settings** > **your name** > **Password & Security**. Tap **Two-Factor Authentication** and turn it **Off** again.

Meanwhile, here are the steps to learn how to bypass 2-step verification on iCloud on the web.

**Step 2**: Click **Sign-In and Security > Account Security**.

![setup icloud 2 factor authentication iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/turn-off-two-factor-authentication-icloud.jpg)

**Step 3**: Click **Turn Off Two-Step Verification.** Answer a security question you've set up previously to finish the process.

## Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you're wondering how to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud, the answer is no, you can't. However, if you don't have access to your trusted device, you can have a code sent to your trusted phone number via an SMS or an automated phone call to prove to Apple that you own the iCloud account.

If this is impossible, you should request [account recovery](https://iforgot.apple.com/) to regain access to your account.

The easiest way to prevent this issue is by adding another phone number to your Apple ID so you'll always have a backup. Here's how.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone X, go to **Settings** and tap on your **Apple ID** > **Password & Security**.

**Step 2**: Tap **Edit** and choose to **Add a Trusted Phone Number**. You'll have to enter your device's passcode to continue.

![add trusted phone number apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/add-trusted-phone-number-icloud.jpg)

**Step 3**: Enter your new phone number. Select a way to receive a verification code via sms or phone call and tap **Send**.

**Step 4**: Enter the verification code and wait for the process to finish.

## Bonus Tips: Forgot Your iCloud Password? Here's What To Do

Using special programs like [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) can help you recover your iOS device if you forget your iCloud password.

Dr.Fone's key features are:

- Removes all types of iPhone locks such as Apple ID password, Face ID, Touch ID, and more.
- Bypass iCloud activation lock.
- Unlock your Apple iPhone X without carrier restrictions.
- Remove MDM profile / bypass MDM lock without data loss.


Here's how to use Dr.Fone if you forget your iCloud password.

**Step 1**: Download and install [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

![unlock icloud using drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2**: Click **Screen Unlock** on the main program window. On the next screen, click **Bypass Activate Lock**.

![unlock icloud using drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/android-screen-unlock-2.png)

**Step 3**: Click **Start** to initiate the process of unlocking your Apple iPhone X without an iCloud password.

![unlock icloud using drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-2.png)

**Note**

Your iPhone will need to be jailbroken before bypassing it using Dr.Fone.

After step 3, there are two possible outcomes for GSM and CDMA iPhone devices.

- If you own a GSM device, the unlocking will do no harm to your iOS device, and you can enjoy your Apple iPhone X as usual.
- If the Apple iPhone X is CDMA, you won't be able to use the Apple iPhone X device for phone calls, cellular data, and iCloud of your new Apple ID.


### Conclusion

Turning on your iCloud's two-factor authentication is necessary for today's high-tech society. It ensures your information is always secure and minimizes the risk of getting hacked or having your account stolen. Once two-factor is active on your Apple ID, Apple provides you with a two-week window to deactivate it if you change your mind.

Meanwhile, if you forgot your iCloud and have a hard time recovering your account, you can try using dedicated programs like Dr.Fone to unlock your iOS device in a few steps.
