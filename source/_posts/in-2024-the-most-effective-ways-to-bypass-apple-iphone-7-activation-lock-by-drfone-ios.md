## 3 Effective Ways to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 7

Ever since the launch of the first iPhone, both iPhone and Apple have seen tremendous growth year after year on account of the new features and capabilities Apple continues to add to the iPhone. Apple has placed the Apple iPhone 7 as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.

## Part 1: Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone 7 gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees.

## Part 3: FAQs

### What is an activation lock?

It is a component intended to prevent any other individual from utilizing your Apple iPhone 7, iPad, or iPod contact, once it's consistently lost or taken. Activation Lock turns on naturally when you turn on the Find My feature on your device.

### Can I remove the activation lock by hard reset?

A hard reset doesn't remove the activation lock from the Apple iPhone 7 device. For instance, if a phone is hard reset with the Google account signed in, the phone will, in any case, request you to enter the account credentials once turned back on.

### How to remove the activation lock when I have my Apple ID and password?

You can unlock your device the same way as the previous owner would do remotely, as stated above. So, when you have the iCloud account credentials, you can follow our steps, and your iPad will unlock.

## Conclusion

Many reasons can compel you to bypass iPad activation Lock without a past user. This article discusses how to remove the iPad activation lock with the assistance of iCloud or settings from iDevices. However, if you don't have the Mac ID credentials of your iPad, you will require help from a third-party tool that can bypass iPad activation lock.
