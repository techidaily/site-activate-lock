In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.**

- **Step 2:** Start setting up the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.
- **Step 3:** During the setup, if the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.
