## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone XS Max device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone XS Max device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone XS Max device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13/.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.

If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.

**Note:** _This method will not remove iCloud from the Apple server. If you check your IMEI, you still have iCloud ON. This method, however, will remove iCloud from the local device iPhone / iPad / iPod._

Besides, Apple only offers 5GB of free storage for each iCloud account. If your iCloud storage is full or getting close, you will get annoying popups every day. You can follow these 14 simple hacks to fix [iCloud storage full](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud-storage-is-full.html) on your Apple iPhone XS Max/iPad.

Choose a method that suits your comfort and device specifics: DNS servers, tools like [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/), or Apple's support. Evaluate methods, watch out for scams, and trust reliable solutions. The journey to an iCloud-free iPhone may have twists, but many have succeeded—so can you. This guide aims to help you reclaim your Apple iPhone XS Max's functionality and demystify iCloud locks. Remember, patience, research, and the right approach are key.
