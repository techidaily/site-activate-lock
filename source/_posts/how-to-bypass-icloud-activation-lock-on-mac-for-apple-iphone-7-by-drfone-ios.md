## How To Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on Mac For Apple iPhone 7?

_How to do Mac activation lock bypass?_

iCloud Activation Lock stands as a reliable security measure in the Apple ecosystem. It protects your Apple devices from unauthorized access and theft. Yet, navigating this security feature can be overwhelming for users locked out of their devices. It can happen due to forgotten passwords or second-hand purchases.

Mac users often seek effective methods to bypass this security measure. They aim to reclaim access to their devices without compromising safety. This article serves as a comprehensive guide, exploring the details of bypassing the iCloud **Activation Lock on Mac**. It will go through various methods, strategies, and best practices to unlock your Mac.

## Part 1. What is Mac Activation Lock?

**Mac Activation Lock**, a key part of Apple's security, safeguards your MacBook by linking it to your Apple ID. Similar to iOS devices, it makes it tough for others to access your device without permission. Once activated, it requires your Apple ID and password for various functions. These include the likes of disabling Find My Mac, erasing the Apple iPhone 7 device, or using it after a factory reset.

This feature works hand-in-hand with the 'Find My' app. It ensures your data's safety even if your MacBook is lost or stolen. Only the rightful owner can disable **Activation Lock Mac** via their Apple ID. Yet, dealing with this security measure might be challenging for genuine users. This is especially true if they face issues like forgotten passwords or when buying a used device.

Navigating through the iCloud **Activation Lock on a MacBook** can be daunting. This is especially true when faced with legitimate scenarios like forgotten passwords. It can also happen in the case of purchasing pre-owned locked devices. Yet, several methods and techniques exist to bypass this security feature. Below, we'll go through various methods for how to bypass iCloud **Activation Lock on Mac**:

### Fix 1. Retrieve Your Password

Forgetting the Apple ID password can often lead to being locked out of your own device due to the iCloud Activation Lock. Fortunately, Apple provides a streamlined process to reset and retrieve forgotten passwords. This allows users to regain entry to their devices. Apple offers a mechanism to reset forgotten passwords via the Apple ID account recovery process.

Visit the [Apple ID account page](https://appleid.apple.com/sign-in) through a web browser on any device. Choose the option that says, "Forgot password?" and continue by following the instructions shown on the screen. You might need to answer security questions, use two-factor authentication, or receive account recovery instructions. It can happen via email or SMS to reset the password.

### Fix 2. Remove Mac Activation Lock from Another Device

When faced with a Mac locked by iCloud Activation Lock, another effective method exists. You can bypass this security measure using another trusted device. That device must be linked to the same Apple ID as the Mac. Employing this method allows you to remove the Activation Lock from the locked Mac through the “Find My” feature. Follow these steps to bypass the **Mac Activation Lock**:

**Step 1.** Utilize a different Apple device, like an iPhone, iPad, or another Mac, that is currently signed in with the identical Apple ID. From there, navigate to the [iCloud website](https://www.icloud.com/) and sign in using your Apple account credentials.
