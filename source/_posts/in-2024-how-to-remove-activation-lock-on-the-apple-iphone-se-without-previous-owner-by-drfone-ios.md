Another way of resetting your iPad or Apple iPhone SE is via the Settings app present on your device. You can unlock a disabled iPad or Apple iPhone SE or remove all data by executing a total wipe of the iPad or Apple iPhone SE using Settings. However, before starting, please ensure that your iPad or Apple iPhone SE is connected to the internet and the “Find My iPhone” feature is disabled on it. You will also need to know the passcode of your iPad or Apple iPhone SE to proceed with this method.

Once you have done all of that, follow the steps given below.

1. Open “Settings” on your iPad or Apple iPhone SE.
2. Go to "General."
3. Navigate to the “Reset” option and click on it.
4. Select the “Erase All Content and Settings” option.
5. Type in your passcode to confirm and proceed. This will wipe all the data on your iPad or Apple iPhone SE.

Based on the version of your iOS, you might be asked to enter your Apple ID password too. It will also ask for the Apple ID password if the "Find My iPhone" feature is enabled on your device. Hence, the process will not be successful without it, and your iPad or Apple iPhone SE will go to Activation Lock. Therefore, Dr.Fone is a simple, recommended, and reliable way of resetting the iPad or Apple iPhone SE without an Apple ID, saving much of the troubles.
