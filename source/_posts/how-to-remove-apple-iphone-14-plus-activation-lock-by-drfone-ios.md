In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

## Part 3: How To Bypass iCloud Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus via the DNS Change Method

Apart from using a paid service to bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus, you can employ a simple free-to-use unlocking method. One such method is the DNS change process. With this approach, you don’t need to use any paid service, and neither do you have to wait for days for the lock to be bypassed.

Here’s how you can unlock and bypass the iCloud Activation Lock by using the DNS change method.

1: On your iCloud Activation interface, press the “Home” button and select the “WiFi” settings option.

2: On your WiFi settings, tap on the circled “I” icon. This action will open the DNS settings.

4: Once you have entered the DNS digits, tap “Back” and finally tap on the “Done” option.

5: To temporarily bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 14 Plus, tap on the “Activation Help” option. You will get a display message that reads “You have successfully connected to my server”.
