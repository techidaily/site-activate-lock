## Part 1: Basic information about iCloud lock

### What Does iCloud Lock Mean?

Part of the normal process of setting up a new iPhone is to register the phone with an Apple ID. Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 14 and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to [bypass the iCloud activation](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html) lock.

### What Does This Mean for You?

If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 14 device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 14 device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone 14 is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.

Now that you know everything you need to know about an iCloud-locked iPhone, read on to find out how to unlock an iCloud-locked iPhone.

## Part 4: How to Unlock iCloud-locked iPhone/iPad/iPod for Free?

If you’re the original user of the iPhone, and you think it’s unfair to shell out extra money to unlock an iPhone that should already be unlocked, then you can visit the Apple Store. You may have forgotten your iCloud details, which include your Apple ID or your password. To get your details back, you can visit the Apple Store and follow the steps to retrieve your details. If you bought an iPhone from a seller, endeavor to ask them if it’s a second-hand iPhone and get the right details from the user.

This might seem like an easy solution. However, it is quite difficult and time-consuming. Apple is extremely difficult about its security. As such, you’ll have to be the original owner of the iPhone, and you’ll need to have all your details if you want to be able to carry out this method. You can try to go about this method, but the chances are strong that you’ll give up soon, in which case you should revisit some methods mentioned earlier.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there are a lot of options with which to **unlock iCloud-locked iPhone/iPad/iPod**. There is a quick method, which is temporary. There is a permanent method, which is easy and safe. Finally, there’s also the free method, but that is extremely complicated.

You can feel free to choose the most suitable method for you, but my recommendation is that you use [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) because in that case, a third party takes over the Apple iPhone 14 SE iCloud bypass and all you have to do is wait a while.

## Part 2. Remove find my iPhone by recovering Apple ID

Another method that can come in quite handy is by consuming the iForgot website for Apple ID recovery. You can consider removing it with the aid of the Apple ID. For this, the iForgot website provides you with the perfect environment for execution. The platform helps you in recovering the password to your ID by following the steps declared below.

**Step 1:** Open the Apple ID page on your browser and tap on the option of “Forgot Apple ID or Password” to redirect yourselves to a new link.

![click-on-forgot-apple-id-and-password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/remove-find-my-iphone-activation-lock-without-apple-id-1.jpg)

**Step 2:** On the new window, provide your Apple ID along with the assorted phone number and tap "Continue."

![enter-your-apple-id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/remove-find-my-iphone-activation-lock-without-apple-id-2.jpg)

**Step 3:** A notification will be sent across the Apple iPhone 14 devices connected across the Apple ID, offering you to reset your password. Access the link to change the password by following the on-screen steps. This successfully changes the password of your Apple ID.

Once you are done saving and securing the credentials of your Apple ID, you need to proceed toward removing the Find My iPhone service by following the steps offered as follows:

**On your Apple iPhone 14:** Open the Settings of your device and tap "iCloud" to proceed. Select the option of "Find My iPhone" and set it to "Off." Provide the Apple ID password for the listed account and tap "Turn Off" to conclude.

![turn-off-find-my-iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/remove-find-my-iphone-activation-lock-without-apple-id-3.jpg)

**Note:** After you turn off the Find My iPhone services, the Activation Lock is automatically disabled.

## Part 3. Remove find my iPhone with Apple support

Another approach that can be taken into consideration is by accessing Apple Support. Contacting Apple Support can be listed as one of the most prolific and conventional methods adopted to retrieve credentials and remove appropriate services readily consumed. However, to enjoy such easy services, you need to have a claim over the Apple iPhone 14 device. It would be both horrendous and confusing to contact Support if you have not had any control over the Apple iPhone 14 device in the past years. This method might be quite easy and cost less to execute; however, you cannot cover Apple devices bought through secondhand vendors. Furthermore, by following the steps described, it is up to the Support to decide on the case and provide you with appropriate results. Few details need to be covered before contacting the Support. By calling them, they would require the following details, at most.

- The Apple AppleCare agreement number
- The device’s serial number
- The phone’s receipt

By providing the following details, Apple Support may help you remove the Find My iPhone across your device and helps you configure your device easily.

![contact-apple-support](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/remove-find-my-iphone-activation-lock-without-apple-id-4.jpg)

## Part 4. Is it possible to remove the activation lock if it's a secondhand iPhone?

Normally, it is up to the previous user with his Apple ID to provide you with the appropriate credentials to remove the activation lock across the Apple iPhone 14 device. For such cases, you need to contact the user himself and explain the reasons for coming up with such a situation. One easy way of confirming the credentials is by going to the locality of the user himself. With this, the phone is just a restart away, followed by the standard activation procedures that would help you remove the Activation Lock across your device.

It isn't easy to follow these steps if you do not own the Apple iPhone 14 device and can't contact the owner. Under such circumstances, you have to use a third-party program. [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) is one of the best programs to remove an iCloud activation lock.

## Conclusion

The article has explained a very comprehensive set of features and tools that can be efficiently consumed to remove the Activation Lock across an iPhone for removing the Find My iPhone settings. The mechanisms stated can provide you with the appropriate execution if followed properly. For this, you need to follow the guide to understand all the dynamics involved in the system.
