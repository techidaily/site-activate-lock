As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone XR device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires.
