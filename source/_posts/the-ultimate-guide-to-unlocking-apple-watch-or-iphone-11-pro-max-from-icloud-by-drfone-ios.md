- **Step 4:** A warning prompt will appear on the screen, indicating that the user should be informed of the operation. Carefully read the agreement and confirm your agreement by ticking the appropriate box. To continue, click the **Got It!** button.
- **Step 5:** Use the on-screen directions to enter DFU Mode on your iOS device. When the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device is initialized in DFU Mode, the program sends a command to restart it. To proceed, use the “**right arrow**” on the right side of your screen.
