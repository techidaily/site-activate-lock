Though they’re contrasting in one way or the other, these methods are similar in that they both function by removing the iCloud lock feature.

## Part 1: Do I Have to Download iCloud Unlocker to Unlock iCloud Account?

When it comes to unlocking the iCloud lock, many people have often wondered whether it’s possible to bypass the iCloud activation lock without necessarily downloading an iCloud unlocking software. The truth of the matter is the fact that you can bypass the iCloud lock without necessarily downloading any type of software. This has been made possible by the presence of online unlocking companies that bypass the iCloud lock.

## Part 2: iCloud Unlocker Download- iCloud Remover

You can easily unlock iCloud account using an online method that requires you to download the iCloud unlocking software. One such method is by using the iCloud Remover software. The software functions by bypassing the iCloud activation lock and unlock iCloud lock. The time required to remove the iCloud lock depends on the make or model of your device. In general, the process takes about 3-5 business days. All you need to enjoy this service is to either submit your IMEI number to the company or download the program from their website. With this method, you can bypass iCloud lock on iPhone 4, 4S, 5, 5S, 5c and iPad devices.

### Steps to Unlock iCloud using iCloud Remover

#### **Step 1:** Log into the Site

The first and foremost thing to do is to visit this website, [http://icloudremover.org/index.html](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare). On its interface, you’ll be in a position to see the “Download” icon located at the top-right side of your screen. It’s from this option that you will be able to download the iCloud remover software. The company, however, recommends users to first and foremost send their IMEI numbers to them so that they can confirm whether the locked device is compatible with their software or not.

#### **Step 2:** Unlock iCloud Lock

Once the company has received your IMEI, they’ll email you with your device model, purchase date, warranty, and carrier lock. If your device is compatible with their method, they’ll email you containing a new email address/account and password required to remove the iCloud lock. You’ll use this information to either go through the iCloud remover download process or simply remove the iCloud lock using the details sent to you.

#### Cons

\-At $145 for the services, some users may find this method way too expensive for an iCloud unlocking service.

\-You need to download the software to enjoy its services.

If you are not the type of person who wants an iCloud remover download to bypass the iCloud lock, simply turn over to the next point where you’ll get the opportunity to know how to bypass the iCloud lock without necessarily using a downloaded software.

## Part 3: Unlock iCloud Lock without Download

The Official iPhone Unlock method happens to be the best unlock iCloud lock method that requires no software whatsoever to bypass the iCloud lock. With this method, all you need is an active internet connection, your unique IMEI number, a valid payment option and your Apple iPhone XS Max or iPad make or model. You only need to spend about £19.99 ($27.00) to get your iCloud lock bypassed, unlike in our first method. The waiting period usually varies from one device to another. However, the optimum time falls between 1-3 business days.

### How to bypass iCloud Activation Lock

#### **Step 1:** Visit Official iPhone Unlock Website

Be sure to insert a valid email, as it will be used to communicate with you the moment your Apple iPhone XS Max iCloud Lock has been bypassed.

#### **Step 3:** Pay Options

With your valid email submitted, you will be requested to enter your payment details. Simply choose between Visa, MasterCard, and American Express and click on the “Pay with Credit or Debit Card” icon.

## Conclusion

From the methods mentioned above, it’s easy to see that it only takes a matter of days to unlock the iCloud account or to completely remove the stubborn iCloud lock. The diversity of both methods allows you to easily pick and use the best method that suits your preferences. Regardless of whether you want to download iCloud remover, or you simply want to go for an easy-to-use and pocket-friendly online platform, the fact remains that both of these methods have got you covered.

The iCloud unlocker download method though effective requires a lot of time to go through it and don’t forget the amount of money used to get it working. On the other hand, what I like about our second method is the fact that it's more efficient and easy to use. With it, I don't have to go through the tiring and complex downloading process, since the company itself bypasses the lock and renders My Apple iPhone XS Max usable.
