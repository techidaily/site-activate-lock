- **Step 6:** At this juncture, you have to determine whether your phone is a GSM or CDMA device. You can see this through **Settings > General > About.** When it’s a CDMA device, the cellular/SIM compatibilities will be disabled. However, you can still use the phone for its other uses. Once you click **Unlock Now**, you’ll see this pop-up warning. Click **Got it!**
