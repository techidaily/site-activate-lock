## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 13 mini device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![check IMEI code on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg)

**Method 2:** Click the "Device" icon in iTunes to access the "Summary" tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 13 mini, tap "Phone Number" under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 13 mini device model.

![look for imei on itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg)

**Method 3:** For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you're on the “General” tab, then select "Phone Number" below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 13 mini device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

## Part 2. Remove find my iPhone by recovering Apple ID

Another method that can come in quite handy is by consuming the iForgot website for Apple ID recovery. You can consider removing it with the aid of the Apple ID. For this, the iForgot website provides you with the perfect environment for execution. The platform helps you in recovering the password to your ID by following the steps declared below.

**Step 1:** Open the Apple ID page on your browser and tap on the option of “Forgot Apple ID or Password” to redirect yourselves to a new link.

**Step 2:** On the new window, provide your Apple ID along with the assorted phone number and tap "Continue."

**Step 3:** A notification will be sent across the Apple iPhone 13 mini devices connected across the Apple ID, offering you to reset your password. Access the link to change the password by following the on-screen steps. This successfully changes the password of your Apple ID.

Once you are done saving and securing the credentials of your Apple ID, you need to proceed toward removing the Find My iPhone service by following the steps offered as follows:

**On your Apple iPhone 13 mini:** Open the Settings of your device and tap "iCloud" to proceed. Select the option of "Find My iPhone" and set it to "Off." Provide the Apple ID password for the listed account and tap "Turn Off" to conclude.

**Note:** After you turn off the Find My iPhone services, the Activation Lock is automatically disabled.

## Part 3. Remove find my iPhone with Apple support

Another approach that can be taken into consideration is by accessing Apple Support. Contacting Apple Support can be listed as one of the most prolific and conventional methods adopted to retrieve credentials and remove appropriate services readily consumed. However, to enjoy such easy services, you need to have a claim over the Apple iPhone 13 mini device. It would be both horrendous and confusing to contact Support if you have not had any control over the Apple iPhone 13 mini device in the past years. This method might be quite easy and cost less to execute; however, you cannot cover Apple devices bought through secondhand vendors. Furthermore, by following the steps described, it is up to the Support to decide on the case and provide you with appropriate results. Few details need to be covered before contacting the Support. By calling them, they would require the following details, at most.

- The Apple AppleCare agreement number
- The device’s serial number
- The phone’s receipt

By providing the following details, Apple Support may help you remove the Find My iPhone across your device and helps you configure your device easily.

## Part 4. Is it possible to remove the activation lock if it's a secondhand iPhone?

Normally, it is up to the previous user with his Apple ID to provide you with the appropriate credentials to remove the activation lock across the Apple iPhone 13 mini device. For such cases, you need to contact the user himself and explain the reasons for coming up with such a situation. One easy way of confirming the credentials is by going to the locality of the user himself. With this, the phone is just a restart away, followed by the standard activation procedures that would help you remove the Activation Lock across your device.

It isn't easy to follow these steps if you do not own the Apple iPhone 13 mini device and can't contact the owner. Under such circumstances, you have to use a third-party program. [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) is one of the best programs to remove an iCloud activation lock.

## Conclusion

The article has explained a very comprehensive set of features and tools that can be efficiently consumed to remove the Activation Lock across an iPhone for removing the Find My iPhone settings. The mechanisms stated can provide you with the appropriate execution if followed properly. For this, you need to follow the guide to understand all the dynamics involved in the system.
