![bypass activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/bypass-activation-lock.jpg)

## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or iPad?

This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery. Without access to the owner’s Apple ID and/or password, accessing the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max device becomes impossible. Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.

This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.

## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

_**A note for users before we proceed with the bypass steps:**

- **Step 5.** Chances are, the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max or iPad will prompt you to enter the original user’s ID and Password. Simply enter the details available to you.
