#### 2\. Online Activation Lock Bypassing Service

Several online services are available that claim to remove activation lock from iPhone. Some of these services are available at absolutely no cost. One cannot expect a high success rate in comparison to the premium paid services. Besides, one may not even receive any warranty for any data or hardware loss or damage due to the service.

There is no need to download any additional tools and programs or hardware for this purpose. Getting started with an activation lock online bypassing service is straightforward.

**Step 1:** Begin by entering the details of the Apple iPhone 8 model.

#### 3\. A Loophole: DNS Bypass

Most iPhones today run on the latest iOS versions. However, if the user has an iPhone running on an older version of the operating system, the DNS method can be used to bypass the Apple iPhone 8 device activation lock. This technique uses a loophole in the Wi-Fi DNS settings on the Apple iPhone 8 device. It tricks the Apple iPhone 8 into thinking that it is unlocked.

Listed below are the steps to be followed to remove the "Find My iPhone" activation lock in the absence of the previous iPhone user.

**Step 1:** Start by setting up the Apple iPhone 8 as a new device. The user must wait until they reach the Wi-Fi settings page.

**Step 2:** On opening the Wi-Fi screen, connect to a strong Wi-Fi network. Next to the chosen network name, tap on the "I" icon available on the right-hand side.

![bypass apple activation lock 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/dns-3.jpg)

- Asia – 104.155.220.58
- Europe – 104.155.28.90
- Australia and Oceania – 35.189.47.23
- North America – 104.154.51.7
- South America – 35.199.88.219

This must get the Apple iPhone 8 unlocked by now.

#### 4\. The Official Approach - Apple Support

Using the official Apple support never goes out of the list of possible approaches for **[activation lock removal](https://drfone.wondershare.com/apple-account/how-to-remove-find-my-iphone-activation-lock-without-apple-id.html)**.

- iPhone receipt

### **Scenario 2: If you can get in touch with the previous owner**

#### 1\. Apple Activation Lock Removal with Screen Passcode

This situation is possible if the new owner can physically contact the original owner of the iPhone. Ask the Apple iPhone 8 owner to enter their screen passcode and unlock the Apple iPhone 8 device. Exit the used Apple ID and remove the **apple activation lock** upon opening it.

At times, the previous owner may not be physically resent near the new iPhone owner. In that scenario, having the person's contact information may come in handy. Next, ask the person to remove their device from iCloud. It may be done remotely by following the steps mentioned below.

**Step 1:** Make use of their Apple ID and passcode to sign in to the iCloud website. Or ask the owner to do so.

**Step 2:** The user needs to click on the "Find My" button. Next, select the Apple iPhone 8 devices to form the "All Devices" menu.
