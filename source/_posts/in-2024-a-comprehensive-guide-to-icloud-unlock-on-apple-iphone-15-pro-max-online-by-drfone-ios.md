## Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with IMEI Code On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max

The iCloud IMEI Unlock method requires you to have your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max IMEI number before proceeding with the iCloud lock removal process. When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we're going to see as we proceed.

In this article, I'm going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.

## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

![jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg)

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![check IMEI code on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg)

**Method 2:** Click the "Device" icon in iTunes to access the "Summary" tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, tap "Phone Number" under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device model.

![look for imei on itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg)

**Method 3:** For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you're on the “General” tab, then select "Phone Number" below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

![look for imei in phone box](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-4.jpg)

### 3\. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone

For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.

## Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?

Many third-party services claim to offer solutions to bypass iCloud activation using the IMEI number. These services propose to unlock iCloud activation by altering or manipulating the IMEI number. They promise a free and swift solution to bypass iCloud activation. Follow these steps to bypass iCloud activation using IMEI:
