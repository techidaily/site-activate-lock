1: On your iCloud Activation interface, press the “Home” button and select the “WiFi” settings option.

2: On your WiFi settings, tap on the circled “I” icon. This action will open the DNS settings.

To those located in the USA/North America, enter 104.154.51.7. To those located in Europe, enter 104.155.28.90. To those in Asia and the rest of the world, enter 104.155.220.58 and 78.109.17.60 respectively.

4: Once you have entered the DNS digits, tap “Back” and finally tap on the “Done” option.

5: To temporarily bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 8 Plus, tap on the “Activation Help” option. You will get a display message that reads “You have successfully connected to my server”.
