## Unlock Your Device: iCloud DNS Bypass Explained and Tested, Plus Easy Alternatives On Apple iPhone 15 Plus

Have you bought a used iPhone or iPad with an active iCloud Activation Lock? Or perhaps you have an Apple device but cannot remember your iCloud password? Without activating iCloud, you cannot utilize locked devices in either scenario.

You might try contacting Apple customer service, but they won't be able to assist you without user identification directly. Even after the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has been authenticated, you will still be bombarded with inquiries, and they may even want the original iOS device payment receipt.

One of the greatest free solutions to prevent these issues is to unlock your Apple iPhone utilizing iCloud DNS Bypass. Read on to know more in this iCloud DNS Bypass Guide.

## Part 1: How Can We Use iCloud DNS Bypass for iOS Devices?

After a factory reset or restoration, every time you set up your iOS device, it will send an activation request to Apple's servers. Apple responds to your request and displays your device's status.

The iCloud DNS Bypass can assist you if you forget your login information (Apple ID or password) or purchase a used device with an iCloud lock activated. It is a free approach to unlocking iCloud.

The readable names are transformed into numerical IP addresses via the Domain Name System (DNS). To launch the program, it makes use of a DNS server that serves as a host.
