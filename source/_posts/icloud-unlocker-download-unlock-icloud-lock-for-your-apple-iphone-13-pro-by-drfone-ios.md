### Method 2. Ask the previous owner to bypass it (iCloud) remotely

The best **Apple iPhone 13 Pro bypass** method is connecting with the past user and having them erase the Apple iPhone 13 Pro from their Apple ID.

- Sign in to iCloud.com and go to Find iPhone.
- Click “All Devices” from the top to open a rundown of the phones connected to their account. It will show all the phones connected to the iCloud account, regardless of whether it's on the web. If this is a family account, it shows every accessory.
- Scroll down until you find the phone you need to eliminate. Click it.
- The site page will show a couple of choices for it. Click "Remove from Account" to disassociate it from iCloud.

### Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

DNS represents the domain name and is a supportive method for bypassing the Apple iPhone 13 Pro activation lock. It controls the DNS server and redirects the authentication way of your phone. It assists you with the Apple iPhone 13 Pro iCloud bypass using these steps:
