## Part 1. About iCloud activation lock on Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 11 Pro

Apple presented a unique security system with a single identification tool to operate with.

Furthermore, this system is not restricted to smartphones and tablets but leads onto other Apple Devices such as the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 11 Pro.

The Find My service presented by Apple is taken further with the Activation Lock. This not only protects the data and the attached applications but prevents the Apple iPhone 11 Pro devices from being wiped out and re-sold to the black market.

Activation Lock ensures that all the data present on your device is typically protected and kept safe from nefarious hands.

#### 1\. Using Apple's iCloud Website

In such cases where you have bought a used Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 11 Pro from another owner, there are high chances that the Apple iPhone 11 Pro device would still be connected to the previous Apple ID. This simply should be covered through contacting the previous owner and obtaining their iCloud’s Account and Password for activation. No other method would guide you in bypassing the iCloud credentials.

You can manage your iCloud settings directly from Apple's iCloud website. To unlock the iCloud on your Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 11 Pro, follow these steps:

1. Go to [iCloud.com](https://www.icloud.com/) and sign in with your Apple ID and password.
2. Click on 'Find iPhone'.
3. Click on 'All Devices' at the top of the map interface, and select your Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 11 Pro.
4. If there's an option to 'Remove from Account,' click on it. If not, proceed to the next step.

#### 2\. Contact Apple Customer Support

Following another case where you own the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 11 Pro and have an original receipt of the purchase, the issue can be solved by contacting Apple Support or going to your nearest Apple Store to get the work done. Apple's customer support can help determine the lock status and guide you through specific steps for unlocking. Here's how to reach them:

1. Visit the [Apple Support](https://support.apple.com/) website.
2. Click on 'Contact Apple Support'.
3. Select 'Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 11 Pro,' then pick 'Apple ID & iCloud'.
4. Choose how you'd like to receive help—via a phone call, chat, or email. Follow their instructions accordingly.

2. Click on 'All Devices' and select your Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 11 Pro.
3. If 'Mark as Lost' is enabled, click to disable it.

You should also keep this mind that in cases where the user intends to sell the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 11 Pro or give it away for service, it is necessary to turn off the Activation Lock by following a set of various steps, which are described as follows.
