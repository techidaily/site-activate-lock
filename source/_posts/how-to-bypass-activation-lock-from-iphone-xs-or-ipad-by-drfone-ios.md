## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone XS or iPad?

This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery. Without access to the owner’s Apple ID and/or password, accessing the Apple iPhone XS device becomes impossible. Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.

This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone XS option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone XS. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone XS or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.

## Part 1: Basic information about iCloud lock

### What Does iCloud Lock Mean?

Part of the normal process of setting up a new iPhone is to register the phone with an Apple ID. Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone XS and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to [bypass the iCloud activation](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html) lock.

### What Does This Mean for You?

If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone XS device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone XS device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone XS is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.

Now that you know everything you need to know about an iCloud-locked iPhone, read on to find out how to unlock an iCloud-locked iPhone.
