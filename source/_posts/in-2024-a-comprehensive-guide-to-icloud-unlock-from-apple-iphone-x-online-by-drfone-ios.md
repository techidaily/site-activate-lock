## Part 1. About iCloud activation lock on Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone X

Apple presented a unique security system with a single identification tool to operate with. The Activation Lock is considered as the core of the complete system under which the associated devices function. Major Apple connections, including iCloud, iTunes, and other identification-oriented features, require the basic Activation Lock. Furthermore, this system is not restricted to smartphones and tablets but leads onto other Apple Devices such as the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone X.

The Find My service presented by Apple is taken further with the Activation Lock. This not only protects the data and the attached applications but prevents the Apple iPhone X devices from being wiped out and re-sold to the black market. Hence, if any user intends to change the settings of the Apple device without having it disconnected from the previous Apple ID, it is far more than impossible to be executed successfully. Activation Lock ensures that all the data present on your device is typically protected and kept safe from nefarious hands. Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone X operates over the similar Apple ID that you have used across other devices, making its recovery and removal quite similar to the conventional methods that are adopted by people throughout the market.
