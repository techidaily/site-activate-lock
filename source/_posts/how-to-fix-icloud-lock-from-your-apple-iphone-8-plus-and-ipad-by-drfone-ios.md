## How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and iPad

There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.

With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.

## Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple

In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.

#### **Step 1:** Enter your Login Details

To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.

#### **Step 2:** Find My iPhone

Once you have gained access to your device, locate the "Find My iPhone" option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It's also the main reason why you can't access your iCloud account.

#### **Step 3:** Restore your Device

With the "Find My iPhone" option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings> General> Reset> Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.

#### **Step 4:** Sign In

With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.

## Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner

Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device happens to be the real owner, then he/she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.

This approach, however, has a downside. It's only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.

## Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock

One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the [Official iPhoneUnlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare).

Your iPhone will start like a default phone without any activation lock. You can access and utilize the Apple iPhone 8 Plus now. Possibly, remember that you can't utilize your new Apple ID's phone call, cellular, and iCloud feature after that process.


## Part 2: FAQs

### 1\. What is Find My?

The Find My feature is an incredible method for keeping your Apple iPhone 8 Plus from getting lost, as it permits you to find and lock it, regardless of whether you have it. For instance, when Find My iPhone is initiated, you can see where your Apple iPhone 8 Plus is. You might use it to show your location to others or play a sound on your lost device, making it easier to find.

To utilize this feature, you need to initiate this feature on your device and utilize a PC or another phone to find, reset or lock your lost iPhone. If you're selling your Apple iPhone 8 Plus or gifting it to someone else, you should first switch off the Find My feature. It becomes very awkward for the next user if the past owner's Find My iPhone feature is still activated.

### 2\. How to turn off Find My?

If you want to reset your Apple iPhone 8 Plus to erase every one of the data and return it to its default condition, Apple expects you to switch off Find My in advance. Also, experts at the Apple store frequently expect you to switch it off before they can repair it.

Switching it off will not erase any of your data, so you don't have to stress over that. It'll simply make it difficult to track down your Apple iPhone 8 Plus on a map when lost.

The best way to switch off the Find My feature is very direct. The following steps will tell you how to make it happen:

- Open the Settings of your Apple iPhone 8 Plus and tap your name or profile.
- Explore the "Find My" option and go for "Find My iPhone."
- If the Find My iPhone feature is initiated, the toggle button on top of the page should be green. Switch the "Find My iPhone" toggle key to turn it off.
- Enter your Apple ID details.
- Affirm your activity, and that's all you need to turn this feature off.

### 3\. Can I bypass iOS Devices like iPad or iPods?

Yes, you can bypass the activation lock on iPhones like iPad and iPods. However, the method is a bit different regarding Apple Watches.

### The Bottom Line
