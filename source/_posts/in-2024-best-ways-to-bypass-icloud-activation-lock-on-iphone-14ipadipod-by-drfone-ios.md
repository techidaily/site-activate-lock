This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 14 option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 14. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 14 or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.

## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 14 or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 14 or iPad Mini.

![add apple id password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/add-apple-id-password.jpg)

_**A note for users before we proceed with the bypass steps:**

- **Step 5.** Chances are, the Apple iPhone 14 or iPad will prompt you to enter the original user’s ID and Password. Simply enter the details available to you.
- **Step 6.** Finally, the best part of the unlocking process; navigate to the settings tab to erase all data. Open up settings, click reset and proceed to erase all content, including settings.
- **Step 7.** At this point, your Apple iPhone 14 or iPad will restart/reboot, allowing you to set up the Apple iPhone 14 device anew.

There are a few web-based resources and tricks that facilitate this procedure. Suffice to say, these methods, known as Jailbreaking, do not work when activation lock is enabled.
