There is no need to download any additional tools and programs or hardware for this purpose. Getting started with an activation lock online bypassing service is straightforward.

**Step 1:** Begin by entering the details of the Apple iPhone 15 model.

#### 3\. A Loophole: DNS Bypass

Most iPhones today run on the latest iOS versions. However, if the user has an iPhone running on an older version of the operating system, the DNS method can be used to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 device activation lock. This technique uses a loophole in the Wi-Fi DNS settings on the Apple iPhone 15 device. It tricks the Apple iPhone 15 into thinking that it is unlocked.

Listed below are the steps to be followed to remove the "Find My iPhone" activation lock in the absence of the previous iPhone user.

**Step 1:** Start by setting up the Apple iPhone 15 as a new device. The user must wait until they reach the Wi-Fi settings page.
