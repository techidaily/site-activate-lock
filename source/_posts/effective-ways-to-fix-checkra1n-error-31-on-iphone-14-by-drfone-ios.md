In this step, the previous owner's iCloud account has been completely removed from the Apple iPhone 14 device, and the Activation Lock has also been removed.

### Method 2. Get the Previous Owner's Apple ID and Password

If you have an iPod and Apple iPhone 14 locked by iCloud, you'll need the previous owner's Apple ID and password to bypass the activation lock and use the Apple iPhone 14 device. iCloud activation locks are put in place to protect your device and data, but if you've purchased a used iPod and Apple iPhone 14 from someone who didn't remove their account information, you'll be stuck with a locked device.
