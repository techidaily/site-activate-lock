## How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone XS Max

Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone XS Max by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone XS Max.

In this article, I'm going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone XS Max from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone XS Max"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.

## Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone

You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone XS Max device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone XS Max and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone XS Max.

#### **Step 1:** Download the Software

## 3 Effective Ways to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone XS Max

Ever since the launch of the first iPhone, both iPhone and Apple have seen tremendous growth year after year on account of the new features and capabilities Apple continues to add to the iPhone. Apple has placed the Apple iPhone XS Max as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.

Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone XS Max. We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.

## Part 1: Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone XS Max gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.

## Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone XS Max)

An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone but forgot to erase the Apple iPhone XS Max device before submitting and consequently, the Apple iPhone XS Max device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that Apple iPhone XS Max to make it useable again. There are a few ways you can go about it.

### Method 1. Bypassing Activation Lock Using Apple ID

Disabling Activation Lock on Apple iPhone XS Max is easy if you have the Apple ID credentials that are associated with the iPhone.

![activation lock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-13-1-1.jpg)

- Step 1: Enter device Recovery Mode and Restore the Apple iPhone XS Max device to factory settings.
- Step 2: When you set up the Apple iPhone XS Max device again, you will be required to sign in to the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone XS Max device. Do that and you are golden!

### Method 2. Bypassing Activation Lock from iCloud Website

You may also do away with Activation Lock using the Find My iPhone app in iCloud remotely by erasing the Apple iPhone XS Max device and removing the Apple iPhone XS Max device from the associated iCloud account.

- Step 1: Visit the iCloud website on a computer at <https://icloud.com>.
- Step 2: Sign In and go to Find iPhone.

![find iphone option in icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-13-2.jpg)

- Step 3: Click All Devices and select the Apple iPhone XS Max device that was sold to the user.
- Step 4: Click Erase iPhone and if the Apple iPhone XS Max device is still there after the erase is complete, click Remove From Account.

![erase iphone and bypass activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-13-3.jpg)

This process requires that the data service be functional on the Apple iPhone XS Max in question, otherwise, this will not work. When the process is done, restart the Apple iPhone XS Max and set it up with your Apple ID to remove the lock.

### Method 3. Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune

If you are an IT administrator and are using Microsoft services, you may have given employees iPhones. When employees leave or are made to leave, it is possible that the Apple iPhone XS Max devices they leave behind are still signed in with a password only they know. There is a way Apple provides for Microsoft Intune to disable Activation Lock for corporate devices.

![what is microsoft intune](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/what-is-intune.png)

- Step 1: Sign in to the admin center on Microsoft Endpoint Manager.
- Step 2: Select Devices under Intune.
- Step 3: Select All Devices.
- Step 4: Locate the Apple iPhone XS Max device you want to disable the lock for, and under the Hardware section, copy the Activation Lock Bypass Code given under Conditional Access.
- Step 5: Under the Overview pane of the Apple iPhone XS Max device, select Wipe.
- Step 6: When the Apple iPhone XS Max device resets, it prompts for the Apple ID and password. Leave the ID blank and enter the bypass code as a password.

The device will be reset, and employees can set it up again with a new Apple ID.

## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone XS Max device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone XS Max device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone XS Max device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13/.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.

If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.

## Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?
