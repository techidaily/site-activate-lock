## Part 2: FAQs

**1\. What can iCloud activation lock do for us?**

Activation Lock assists you with keeping your device secure, regardless of whether it's in the wrong hands. Moreover, it can increase your possibility of recovering the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device. Regardless of whether you delete your device remotely, the activation lock can keep on stopping anybody from reactivating your device without your consent.

As mentioned above, one can remove the activation lock with a few simple steps. Moreover, if none of these methods work, Dr.Fone is still there for the rescue. You can use their advanced tools to unlock all locks on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, iPad, iPod, or Apple watches.

**3\. How to turn off Find My?**

- Open the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Settings and tap your name.
- Explore “Find My” and go to "Find My iPhone".
- If Find My iPhone is enabled, the toggle button on top of the page should be green. Switch the button to turn it off.
