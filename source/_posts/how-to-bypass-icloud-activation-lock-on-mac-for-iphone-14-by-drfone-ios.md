Just decide the correct method and approach according to your circumstances and availability of resources. If you are a seller, you should disable the activation lock before selling your phone. Erasing the Apple iPhone 14 device back to factory settings will not put the buyer in any trouble.

#### To Disable Activation Lock

- Go to settings > Tap your name at the top of the list > Tap iCloud > Tap Find My iPhone > Toggle the “Find My iPhone” > Type your Apple ID password.

#### To Reset The Device

- Go to settings > General > Reset > Click “erase all settings” >Give confirmation > Wait until the process is complete.

We hope this post will help you figure out the right way to remove **the Find My iPhone/ iPad Activation Lock without a previous owner**. If you have any questions, please leave us in the comment section below.
