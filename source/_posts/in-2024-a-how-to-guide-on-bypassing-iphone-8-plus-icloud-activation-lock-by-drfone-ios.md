### Method 2. Ask the previous owner to bypass it (iCloud) remotely

The best **Apple iPhone 8 Plus bypass** method is connecting with the past user and having them erase the Apple iPhone 8 Plus from their Apple ID.

- Sign in to iCloud.com and go to Find iPhone.
- Click “All Devices” from the top to open a rundown of the phones connected to their account. It will show all the phones connected to the iCloud account, regardless of whether it's on the web. If this is a family account, it shows every accessory.
- Scroll down until you find the phone you need to eliminate. Click it.
- The site page will show a couple of choices for it. Click "Remove from Account" to disassociate it from iCloud.
