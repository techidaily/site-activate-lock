## Part 1: 4 Efficient Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone 6s Plus iCloud Activation Lock

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner

For an **Apple iPhone 6s Plus iCloud bypass**, you'll require a couple of significant pieces of data:

- Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.
- If a device doesn't have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 6s Plus passcode in mind.

![owners apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 6s Plus iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 6s Plus.
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.
- **Step 3:** Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.
- **Step 4:** Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.

On the other hand, if you see the lock screen passcode, you can type the passcode and set up the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device without the Apple ID.

With the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device completely set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.

### 2\. Use DNS Bypass

**What is DNS?**

Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.

You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can't utilize the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform **Apple iPhone 6s Plus iCloud bypass** via DNS bypass.

**Steps to Follow:**

**Note:** Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.

- **Step 1:** Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.
- **Step 2:** When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.

_**Note:** If you don't see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button> More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it._

- **Step 3:** You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.
- **Step 4:** Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90

- **Step 5:** After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.
- **Step 6:** You will see the next page choice; don't click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-2.jpg)

There are multiple ways that you can do that, and we will share the ways with you below:

### Method 1: Removing the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device from the First Owner's iCloud

Probably one of the easiest and fastest ways to bypass the activation lock is by contacting the owner to remove the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device that you have from their iCloud. If you can still make contact with them, you can try this option and reach out to them.

### Method 2: Contact Apple to Remove The Activation Lock

If you cannot contact the previous owner, you can then [reach out to Apple directly](https://al-support.apple.com/#/kbase) and provide proof that you have inherited or purchased the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. Documents such as receipts and death certificates if inherited, then you can reach out to their support team to unlock your device.

### Method 3: Unlock your device using DNS

Instead of bypassing Apple directly, you can try to bypass the DNS server, and you can do this by following the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Restart your device.
- **Step 2:** Go through the process of setting up until you come across the “Choose Wi-Fi Network”.
- **Step 3:** Then choose “More Wi-Fi settings” and tap on “I”.
- **Step 4:** Choose “Configure DNS” and select “Manual”.
- **Step 5:** From there, choose “+Add server” then choose the address as per your location below and click “Save”.

- **Step 6:** Select “Ask to Join Networks” and enter the password then click on “Join”.
