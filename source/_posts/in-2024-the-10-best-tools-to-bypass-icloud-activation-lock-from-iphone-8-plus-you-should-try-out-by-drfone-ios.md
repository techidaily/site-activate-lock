Navigating through the iCloud **Activation Lock on a MacBook** can be daunting. This is especially true when faced with legitimate scenarios like forgotten passwords. It can also happen in the case of purchasing pre-owned locked devices. Yet, several methods and techniques exist to bypass this security feature. Below, we'll go through various methods for how to bypass iCloud **Activation Lock on Mac**:

### Fix 1. Retrieve Your Password

Forgetting the Apple ID password can often lead to being locked out of your own device due to the iCloud Activation Lock. Fortunately, Apple provides a streamlined process to reset and retrieve forgotten passwords. This allows users to regain entry to their devices. Apple offers a mechanism to reset forgotten passwords via the Apple ID account recovery process.

Visit the [Apple ID account page](https://appleid.apple.com/sign-in) through a web browser on any device. Choose the option that says, "Forgot password?" and continue by following the instructions shown on the screen. You might need to answer security questions, use two-factor authentication, or receive account recovery instructions. It can happen via email or SMS to reset the password.

### Fix 2. Remove Mac Activation Lock from Another Device

When faced with a Mac locked by iCloud Activation Lock, another effective method exists. You can bypass this security measure using another trusted device. That device must be linked to the same Apple ID as the Mac. Employing this method allows you to remove the Activation Lock from the locked Mac through the “Find My” feature. Follow these steps to bypass the **Mac Activation Lock**:

**Step 1.** Utilize a different Apple device, like an iPhone, iPad, or another Mac, that is currently signed in with the identical Apple ID. From there, navigate to the [iCloud website](https://www.icloud.com/) and sign in using your Apple account credentials.

**Step 2.** On the iCloud website, tap the grid icon from the top right corner and select "Find My." Here, enter your password and click on "All Devices." Choose the locked Mac from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device and go on to tap "Remove This Device." Now, follow the on-screen prompts to complete the process.

### Fix 3. Ask The Previous Owner for Help

Have you acquired a second-hand Mac that is locked with iCloud Activation Lock? If faced with this scenario, seeking assistance from the previous owner can prove to be a valuable solution. Describe your situation to the previous owner and kindly ask them to log in to their iCloud account for support. Otherwise, they can use the iCloud website to disassociate the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device from their account.

They can do this by removing the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device from their iCloud account or disabling Find My Mac. Seeking help from the previous owner to remove the **Activation Lock Mac** is often the most straightforward method.

## Part 3. FAQs About Activation Lock on Mac

1. **Is Bypassing Activation Lock Legal?**

Bypassing Activation Lock mechanisms frequently fall into a legal gray area. The intention can be to regain access to a locked device legitimately owned by the user. Yet, circumventing security features may violate terms of service. It's important to know that attempting to bypass the Activation Lock might void warranties.

2. **How Does Activation Lock Work on Mac?**

This feature effectively prevents unauthorized users from accessing or using a locked Mac.

3. **What Are the Risks of Bypassing Activation Lock?**

Bypassing Activation Lock might carry the following risks and implications:
