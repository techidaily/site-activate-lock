## Part 1: 4 Efficient Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 iCloud Activation Lock

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner

For an **Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass**, you'll require a couple of significant pieces of data:

- Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 14 device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.
- If a device doesn't have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 14 passcode in mind.

![owners apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 14.
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 14 device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.
- **Step 3:** Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.
- **Step 4:** Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.

With the Apple iPhone 14 device completely set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.

### 2\. Use DNS Bypass

**What is DNS?**

Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.

You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can't utilize the Apple iPhone 14 device.

- **Step 1:** Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.
- **Step 2:** When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.

_**Note:** If you don't see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button> More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it._

- **Step 3:** You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.
- **Step 4:** Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90

- **Step 5:** After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.
- **Step 6:** You will see the next page choice; don't click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.

## Part 2: FAQs

### 1\. Why do we need to bypass the iCloud activation lock?

iCloud is software that secures your backups, photos, and passcodes, allows access to Apple's credentials, and much more. iCloud activation lock is one of the features of 'Find Phone' that secures your device's personal information from falling into the wrong hands.

However, it can be trouble if you buy a second-hand iOS device. It can be difficult to access iCloud if the previous one has enabled activation lock. That's why you need to bypass iOS 17, so you can access all the applications and secure all backups.

### 2\. Is it legal to bypass the iCloud activation lock?

Bypassing the iCloud activation lock with or without the previous owner is legal. There are no illegal ways to unlock it. The steps and tools are all legal and safe to bypass the iOS 17 iCloud activation lock. Without bypassing the activation lock, you won't be able to use your iOS device freely or at all.

### 3\. What will happen after a successful bypass?

The data you previously had on your iOS device will be permanently erased as soon as iOS 17 has been bypassed. Additionally, the Apple iPhone 14 device will be set up as a new one. After finishing the bypass, you can now enter all your details and start using the Apple iPhone 14 device. Furthermore, you can back up all your data easily as the previous one has been deleted.
