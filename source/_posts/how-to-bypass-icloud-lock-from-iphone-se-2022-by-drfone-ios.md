## Part 1: What is iCloud Activation Lock in iPhone11/12?

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature implemented by Apple on Apple iPhone SE (2022) and other iOS devices. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access to the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device by linking it to the owner's Apple ID and iCloud account. When the Activation Lock is enabled, the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device requires the owner's Apple ID and password to set up or restore the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device, making it difficult for thieves to use or sell stolen iPhones. The Activation Lock ensures the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device's data remains secure and can only be accessed by the rightful owner.

Regardless of whether you erase your device, Activation Lock can keep on preventing anybody from reactivating your device without your consent. Regardless of whether your device is stolen, the other person will require either your device password or your Apple ID credentials to use the phone. Even if they try resetting your device through DFU mode, they will not have the option to reactivate and utilize it without **Apple iPhone SE (2022) iCloud unlock**.

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature designed to protect iPhones from unauthorized use. However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone SE (2022) locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let's dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone SE (2022).

### Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password

The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone SE (2022) and ask for their Apple ID and password. To **bypass Apple iPhone SE (2022)**, you need to have some data in hand:

- Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you're the second owner.
- If a device doesn't have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone SE (2022) passcode.

![enter icloud details](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone SE (2022) iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.
- **Step 3:** Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.
- **Step 4:** Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.

However, if you see the Apple iPhone SE (2022) passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device without the iCloud account.

With the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.

### Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely

If the iPhone's first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it's time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.

However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.

So, if it's not a stolen device, you don't need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone SE (2022) device and **bypass Apple iPhone SE (2022)** by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.
- **Step 2:** Click the Apple iPhone SE (2022) devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.

![remove or erase](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-2.jpg)

### Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device's features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone SE (2022), your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.

**Limitations of this Features**

When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn't true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.

The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.
