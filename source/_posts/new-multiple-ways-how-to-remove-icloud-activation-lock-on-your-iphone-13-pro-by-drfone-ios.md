## Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device to a specific Apple ID.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.

## Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password

If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device, learning **how to remove iCloud Activation Lock** is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.

If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device. If the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to **Settings >** Tap on the profile on top of the app > **Sign Out**.

- **Step 1:** Go to <www.iCloud.com/find> on any web browser.
- **Step 2:** Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device owner’s ID) and password.
