**1\. What can iCloud activation lock do for us?**

Activation Lock assists you with keeping your device secure, regardless of whether it's in the wrong hands. Moreover, it can increase your possibility of recovering the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device.

As mentioned above, one can remove the activation lock with a few simple steps. Moreover, if none of these methods work, Dr.Fone is still there for the rescue. You can use their advanced tools to unlock all locks on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, iPad, iPod, or Apple watches.
