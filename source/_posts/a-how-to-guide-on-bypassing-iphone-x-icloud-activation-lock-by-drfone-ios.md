## A How-To Guide on Bypassing Apple iPhone X iCloud Activation Lock

You may also need it to erase your data or reactivate and utilize your device. That is to say, iCloud Activation Lock keeps your device from getting into the wrong hands.

Regarding this security plan, if you purchased a second-hand iDevice with "Find My iPhone" enabled, you would be stuck after resetting it without a passcode.

## Part 1: 4 Quick Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone X iCloud activation lock

### Method 1. Ask the previous owner for Apple ID and passcode

The first thing you can do is to [ask the previous owner](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/how-to-remove-activation-lock-without-previous-owner.html) for their Apple iCloud account credentials. You can use these details to open the account and use it for the **Apple iPhone X bypass**.

However, it is the least suggested and least effective method. It is because asking someone about their account details is unethical. The iCloud account has a lot of personal information about the user. Therefore, no one will be willing to hand you the account credentials unless they are your close relatives.

### Method 2. Ask the previous owner to bypass it (iCloud) remotely

The best **Apple iPhone X bypass** method is connecting with the past user and having them erase the Apple iPhone X from their Apple ID. The previous user can enter their password on the Activation Lock screen or access iCloud. The following are the steps that the past user ought to follow:

- Sign in to iCloud.com and go to Find iPhone.
- Click “All Devices” from the top to open a rundown of the phones connected to their account. It will show all the phones connected to the iCloud account, regardless of whether it's on the web. If this is a family account, it shows every accessory.
- Scroll down until you find the phone you need to eliminate. Click it.
- The site page will show a couple of choices for it. Click "Remove from Account" to disassociate it from iCloud.

### Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

DNS represents the domain name and is a supportive method for bypassing the Apple iPhone X activation lock. It controls the DNS server and redirects the authentication way of your phone. It assists you with the Apple iPhone X iCloud bypass using these steps:

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-se-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

**Step 1.** Go to the Wi-Fi settings and click Configure IP. Then choose Manual and click "Add Server."

- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58

## 3 Effective Ways to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone X

Ever since the launch of the first iPhone, both iPhone and Apple have seen tremendous growth year after year on account of the new features and capabilities Apple continues to add to the iPhone. Apple has placed the Apple iPhone X as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.

Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone X. We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.

## Part 1: Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone X gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.

## Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone X)

An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone but forgot to erase the Apple iPhone X device before submitting and consequently, the Apple iPhone X device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that Apple iPhone X to make it useable again. There are a few ways you can go about it.

### Method 1. Bypassing Activation Lock Using Apple ID

Disabling Activation Lock on Apple iPhone X is easy if you have the Apple ID credentials that are associated with the iPhone.

![activation lock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-13-1-1.jpg)

- Step 1: Enter device Recovery Mode and Restore the Apple iPhone X device to factory settings.
- Step 2: When you set up the Apple iPhone X device again, you will be required to sign in to the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone X device. Do that and you are golden!

### Method 2. Bypassing Activation Lock from iCloud Website

You may also do away with Activation Lock using the Find My iPhone app in iCloud remotely by erasing the Apple iPhone X device and removing the Apple iPhone X device from the associated iCloud account.

- Step 1: Visit the iCloud website on a computer at <https://icloud.com>.
- Step 2: Sign In and go to Find iPhone.

![find iphone option in icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-13-2.jpg)

- Step 3: Click All Devices and select the Apple iPhone X device that was sold to the user.
- Step 4: Click Erase iPhone and if the Apple iPhone X device is still there after the erase is complete, click Remove From Account.

![erase iphone and bypass activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-13-3.jpg)

This process requires that the data service be functional on the Apple iPhone X in question, otherwise, this will not work. When the process is done, restart the Apple iPhone X and set it up with your Apple ID to remove the lock.

### Method 3. Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune

If you are an IT administrator and are using Microsoft services, you may have given employees iPhones. When employees leave or are made to leave, it is possible that the Apple iPhone X devices they leave behind are still signed in with a password only they know. There is a way Apple provides for Microsoft Intune to disable Activation Lock for corporate devices.

![what is microsoft intune](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/what-is-intune.png)

- Step 1: Sign in to the admin center on Microsoft Endpoint Manager.
- Step 2: Select Devices under Intune.
- Step 3: Select All Devices.
- Step 4: Locate the Apple iPhone X device you want to disable the lock for, and under the Hardware section, copy the Activation Lock Bypass Code given under Conditional Access.
- Step 5: Under the Overview pane of the Apple iPhone X device, select Wipe.
- Step 6: When the Apple iPhone X device resets, it prompts for the Apple ID and password. Leave the ID blank and enter the bypass code as a password.

The device will be reset, and employees can set it up again with a new Apple ID.
