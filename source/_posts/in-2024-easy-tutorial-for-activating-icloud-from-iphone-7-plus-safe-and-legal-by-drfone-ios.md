## Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 7 Plus has an iCloud account lock on it?

If your Apple iPhone 7 Plus has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.

At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as [iCloud Activation Lock](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html). What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device's files, features, and functions.

This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy [a second-hand iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html) from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device from them) to give you the username and password.

It doesn't matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 7 Plus. Whether you [jailbreak](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html) it, [reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html) it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 7 Plus.

If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 7 Plus or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.

## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

![jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg)

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 7 Plus device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.
