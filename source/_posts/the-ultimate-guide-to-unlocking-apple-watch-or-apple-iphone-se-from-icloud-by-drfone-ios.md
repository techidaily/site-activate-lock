## The Ultimate Guide to Unlocking Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone SE from iCloud

Activation Lock is considered one of the most protective layers of any Apple device that keeps it off the hands of any user who would misuse your data. While ensuring the protection of all the data of your device, it offers a unique set of security-enhanced environment that helps you manage all your data over a single identification protocol. This identification protocol interconnects all the Apple devices with each other. Such an example can be taken from the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone SE that interconnects its structure with your Apple devices that are operating under a similar Apple ID. Under such circumstances where you accidentally lock your Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone SE iCloud, several techniques can be adapted to cover the issue efficiently. To regain your access to the iCloud of your Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone SE along with the data it holds, this article provides you with a set of instructions that can be implemented to unlock the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone SE with ease.

## Part 1. About iCloud activation lock on Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone SE

Apple presented a unique security system with a single identification tool to operate with. The Activation Lock is considered as the core of the complete system under which the associated devices function. Major Apple connections, including iCloud, iTunes, and other identification-oriented features, require the basic Activation Lock. Furthermore, this system is not restricted to smartphones and tablets but leads onto other Apple Devices such as the Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone SE.

The Find My service presented by Apple is taken further with the Activation Lock. This not only protects the data and the attached applications but prevents the Apple iPhone SE devices from being wiped out and re-sold to the black market. Hence, if any user intends to change the settings of the Apple device without having it disconnected from the previous Apple ID, it is far more than impossible to be executed successfully. Activation Lock ensures that all the data present on your device is typically protected and kept safe from nefarious hands. Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone SE operates over the similar Apple ID that you have used across other devices, making its recovery and removal quite similar to the conventional methods that are adopted by people throughout the market.

## Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with IMEI Code On your Apple iPhone SE

The iCloud IMEI Unlock method requires you to have your Apple iPhone SE IMEI number before proceeding with the iCloud lock removal process. When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we're going to see as we proceed.

In this article, I'm going to elaborate on how you can easily bypass the iCloud activation lock with the help of the iCloud IMEI unlock.

## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

![jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg)

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone SE device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![check IMEI code on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg)

**Method 2:** Click the "Device" icon in iTunes to access the "Summary" tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone SE, tap "Phone Number" under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone SE device model.

![look for imei on itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg)

**Method 3:** For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you're on the “General” tab, then select "Phone Number" below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone SE device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

### 3\. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone

For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.
