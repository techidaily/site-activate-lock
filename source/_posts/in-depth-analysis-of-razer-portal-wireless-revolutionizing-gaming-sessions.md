 _Flexispot provided us with a review unit for one of our writers to test. Read on for the full review._

 Since I’m still working from home, I’ve been using a built-in desk in my bedroom. It left me hunched over all day, and I would feel my back aching by the time I logged off my work VPN. Even worse with this desk, I couldn’t adjust it. I needed something that would not only fit into my hundred-year-old home aesthetic but would allow me to shift and stretch my back when I needed to.

 The Flexispot was the answer to everything I needed in my workspace: classy; modern; and completely adjustable.

 Cue the Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk. The Flexispot was the answer to everything I needed in my workspace: classy; modern; and completely adjustable. After a week of testing, it’s safe to say I’ve never been so madly in love with a piece of furniture.

## Design: Mixing the old with the new

 This standing desk’s design and aesthetic gave me an executive feel when I set it up. First things first—it’s really heavy, clocking in at around 100 pounds if the packaging is to be believed. I can’t recommend handling the box by yourself, and, had I tried that myself, I would have probably been squished trying to haul it up two flights of stairs.

 It’s this American design, along with rustic knobs on the sole drawer, that give it a timeless look that can complement any home.

 The wooden veneer immediately caught my eye. Named after the famous Theodore Roosevelt, this desk incorporates a wooden walnut veneer to give its classic look. It’s this American design, along with rustic knobs on the sole drawer, that give it a timeless look that can complement any home. Even better were the two USB ports that were incorporated beside the buttons for raising and lowering the desk.

## Performance and Usage: Adjustable and comfortable

 Once I set the desk up, I sat down and felt like a queen in my castle. Even at its lowest, the desk provided that ergonomic feel I desperately need in my home office setup. The two legs of the desk sit far enough back, and the desk is wide so I didn’t have to worry about kicking the legs accidentally. That said, I live in a house with cats that shed, and I noticed that the hair did stick and stand out on the metal.

 That wasn’t the only place where I noticed minor cosmetic issues. Because the surface is made of veneer, every time I left a smudge on the desk, be it just general PC use or if I accidentally dropped a tortilla chip, it showed. Since it’s veneer, I could clean it up just as easily. If you’re wanting a desk that doesn’t look like it’s been used, this desk is not for you, but if you don’t mind gentling wiping down the desk every so often for cosmetic reasons, then it will be perfect for your home office needs.

 The Theodore Standing Desk also turned out to be the perfect place to store my[Jabra Talk 45 Headset](https://www.lifewire.com/jabra-talk-45-review-5070286#:~:text=A%20great%2C%20feature%2Dpacked%20Bluetooth,with%20its%20voice%20command%20features.) and[Microsoft RVF Arc Touch Mouse](https://www.lifewire.com/microsoft-rvf-arc-touch-mouse-review-4799143) so I wouldn’t keep losing them around the house. The desk’s drawer is about three inches deep, so it could also easily store important papers. And, since the desk space is so large, I could easily fit two 17-inch laptops on there and have extra space to hold my cell phone, planner, and a desk lamp with room to spare.

## Controls: Tap a button

 If I got tired of sitting, usually with a cat on my lap, I could easily convert this into a standing desk thanks to two buttons that raise and lower the desk through motorized controls. While it was a little noisy, the noise doesn’t seem atypical for any standing desk models on the market. I stopped the desk when it rose to conform to my height of 5 feet, 8 inches, but the desk can go up to nearly 50 inches for people who need the extra height.

 However, one of my biggest gripes about the controls is that sometimes the buttons didn’t register when I first pressed them. It isn’t a big deal, because I assume the desk is waking up from some kind of sleep mode, but sometimes it took pressing the button twice to raise or lower it. Personally, this wouldn’t deter me from investing in this because once it goes, it’s a smooth motion, giving you plenty of time to adjust any cords or move things around.

## Price: A steal at the price

 At around $500, before desk accessories like a[standing desk mat](https://www.lifewire.com/best-standing-desk-mats-4155870) , the Flexispot Theodore is very reasonably priced. Keep in mind that you’re not paying for real wood, which factors into the price tag, but a wood veneer finish. Fancier, more modern-looking standings desks can run close to $1,000\.

## FlexiSpot Theodore vs. Rain Design iLevel 2 Laptop Stand

 Let’s say that perhaps a standing desk you’re thinking about investing in a[standing desk converter](https://www.lifewire.com/best-standing-desks-5118383) like the Rain Design iLevel 2 Laptop Stand. At around $51, it seems like it would be a no-brainer to go for the cost-effective option here.

 However, the only feature you’re getting for a standing desk converter is exactly that—a converter. And, coming from personal experience using one, when it folds down, it’s usually still thick enough that it’s not flush with the desk, and that can cause ergonomic wrist issues, especially if you’re using a laptop or an[ergonomic keyboard](https://www.lifewire.com/best-ergonomic-keyboards-4147386) .

 While the Rain Design’s stand may look initially like the more optimal choice because you can keep your current home setup, the Flexispot Theodore comes with complete height adjustability, which is something that the Rain Design can’t really compete with, especially since the Rain is designed for laptops instead of a desktop. The Theodore Standing Desk takes this into account with its 99-pound weight limit. If you prefer to work with your current setup, then the Rain Design might be a better option for your space. However, if you want to have complete adjustability, then the FlexiSpot is the best option for your work-from-home needs.

 Final Verdict

**Simply amazing for working from home.**

 The complete height adjustability and the complimentary USB ports on the Flexispot Theodore Standing Desk are perfect for any home that wants to retain a classic look while getting a major modern upgrade. With the small storage drawer, it’s the perfect standing desk to complete any home office.
