The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature implemented by Apple on Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and other iOS devices. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access to the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device by linking it to the owner's Apple ID and iCloud account. When the Activation Lock is enabled, the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device requires the owner's Apple ID and password to set up or restore the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device, making it difficult for thieves to use or sell stolen iPhones.

The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max and ask for their Apple ID and password. To **bypass Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max**, you need to have some data in hand:

- Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you're the second owner.

![enter icloud details](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.
- **Step 3:** Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.
- **Step 4:** Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.

With the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.

### Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely

If the iPhone's first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it's time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.

However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.

So, if it's not a stolen device, you don't need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device and **bypass Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max** by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.
