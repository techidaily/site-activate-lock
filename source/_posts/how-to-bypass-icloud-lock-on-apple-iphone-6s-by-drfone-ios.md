## Part 1: Basic knowledge about iCloud activation lock

### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 6s, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost. Your Apple iPhone 6s should be iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6S, or 6S + to have the services of the iCloud activation lock. For phones on iOS 7 and above versions, the activation lock is auto-enabled once the Apple iPhone 6s is switched on.

### What is the iCloud activation lock used for?

An iCloud lock is basically for the security of an individual’s phone to not misuse and your details are safe. Once the 'Find My iPhone’ feature is enabled on your Apple devices, Apple’s activation server saves your Apple Id. Henceforth whenever your phone is turned off or performs any type of action such as erasing the Apple iPhone 6s device or reactivating the Apple iPhone 6s device, then your device will ask for unlocking iCloud activation.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone 6s was iCloud activation locked?

If you are purchasing an iPhone or any other Apple device from someone, you need to make sure that the Apple device is no longer linked to the prior owner's account. To make sure you are on the safe side, you could check it for yourself. There are two ways to check:

1\. You can visit [https://icloud.com/activationlock](https://icloud.com/activationlock) from any Computer or MAC to check the present Activation Lock status of the Apple iPhone 6s device.

2\. Follow the steps below to be sure that you can use your Apple iPhone 6s device hassle-free:

1) Switch on the Apple iPhone 6s device and slide to unlock it.

If the screen displays a passcode lock screen or you can see the Home Screen, the Apple iPhone 6s device you have purchased has not been erased. The seller will go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Ensure the seller clears the phone before he hands it over to you for use.

![erase all content and settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719307921421.jpg)

2) Set up your device.

Once you have selected the language, country, and connected to a network, the Apple iPhone 6s device will start activation. If the Apple iPhone 6s device prompts you for the previous owner’s

Apple ID and password, the Apple iPhone 6s device is still linked to an earlier used account. You should go back to the seller and ask them to give you their password. If the previous owner of the Apple device cannot be located or is not present, the seller can try to remove the Apple iPhone 6s device by going to [https://www.icloud.com/find](https://www.icloud.com/find).

![activate iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719308614183.jpg)

Once this is done, and your device prompts you for 'Set up our iPhone/iPad/iPod’ as you turn it on, then you know your device is ready for use.

![set up our iphone/ipad/ipod](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719307661722.jpg)

## Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with IMEI Code On your Apple iPhone 6s

The iCloud IMEI Unlock method requires you to have your Apple iPhone 6s IMEI number before proceeding with the iCloud lock removal process. When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we're going to see as we proceed.

## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 6s device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

**Method 3:** For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you're on the “General” tab, then select "Phone Number" below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 6s device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.
