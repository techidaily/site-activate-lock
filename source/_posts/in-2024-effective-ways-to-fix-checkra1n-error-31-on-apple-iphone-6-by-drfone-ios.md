It is safe during the process. So, how about we begin?

Explore four practical methods to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock on your iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 6. These solutions help you regain access to your device and its features, enabling you to enjoy your iPad without any restrictions.

### Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner

The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To **bypass iPad 3** activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 6 device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.

However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 6 device.

**Step 2.** On your iPad, go to the "Settings" application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.

- If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to "iCloud" and sign out.
- If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click "Sign Out."

**Step 3.** It will request the password to your Apple account. Enter it and turn the iPad off. When done, you will not go over the activation lock screen again, and that's how you **bypass iPad 2** activation lock.

### Method 2. Ask the previous owner for the lock removal

If the previous owner failed to do this before selling the iPad to you, this shouldn't cause an issue. But it might be a problem if they have sold you a stolen phone and don't have the remotest clue about the Apple ID.

You don't need to worry about the iPad activation lock if it's a genuine phone. The past user can remotely wipe out the iPad Apple account without having the phone in their control by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Explore the appleid.apple.com site from a web browser and sign in with your Apple ID details.

![find iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-2.jpg)

**Step 2.** Click the Apple iPhone 6 devices tab to see every one of the connected iDevices.

**Step 3.** Pick your iPad model from the list of devices.

**Step 4.** Then, at that point, click the "Remove from Account" button to get it unlocked. That's how you can perform the **iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass.**

### Method 3. Use DNS Bypass

iCloud DNS bypass proves useful when you want to unlock a second-hand iPad and know practically nothing about the past user. It's likewise productive if you can't find your iCloud username or password. The steps in DNS **iPad 2 iCloud bypass** are basic; here are the steps.

**Step 1.** When you switch on your device, pick your preferred language and region from the menu.

**Step 2.** Click "Continue" to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect to Wi-Fi, search for the "I" logo near the Wi-Fi tab.

**Step 3.** Presently, disconnect the Wi-Fi, go to "Connection Settings," and snap "Forget this Network."

**Step 4.** Click the "I" and enter a DNS server IP address to bypass the iCloud activation lock. You can browse the rundown underneath as indicated by your area:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other regions of the world: 78.100.17.60

**Step 5.** Click the "Back" button on the left half of your screen. Turn on Wi-Fi, select the correct network, and enter the passcode.

![activate your device](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-5.jpg)

**Step 6.** Click "Next Page" and tap the "Back" button to enter the iCloud bypass screen.

**Step 7.** You can now set up your applications and utilize your device.

### Method 4. Seek Help from Apple Support

If there are no choices for contacting the past owner of the iPad, you can ask Apple backing to assist you with the **iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 6 iCloud bypass**. That may not be a simple process, but if you have the expected documents (for individuals who got verification of the purchase from the seller), Apple will be willing to help you.

One way to bypass the Find My iPhone activation lock from your iPad without the owner is to introduce proof of purchase to the Apple support group. When you give this to Apple, they can confirm the first owner of the phone and afterward can assist you with the **iPad 2 iCloud bypass**. After confirmation of purchase, they might request different documents, like one of your ID cards.

If you purchased the phone from your family member or somebody who has died, then your other choice to remove the lock is to show their death certificate to Apple. Apple will then, at that point, check the files and could unlock the iPad for you.

In the two cases, it depends on Apple to conclude whether they are happy with your files and if they might want to **bypass iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 6** lock.
