## Part 2: 5 Easy Methods to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on iPod and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max

The most common question is how to bypass the iCloud activation lock on their iPhones, iPads, or iPod and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max touches. While you can use several methods to achieve this, we've compiled a list of five of the most effective ones below.

### Method 1. Make the Previous Owner Remove It Remotely

If you have a personal relationship with the previous owner of the iOS device, you might be able to ask them to help you remove the Find My iPhone Activation Lock remotely using iCloud.com:

**Step 1.** Sign in to iCloud using your Apple ID and password by going to the official website.

**Step 2.** You can select the associated device by clicking All Devices at the top of the screen.

**Step 3.** You can erase the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device by clicking "Erase \[device\]".

**Step 4.** Last but not least, click "Remove from the account".

![remove activation lock on ipod](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/bypass-ipod-activation-lock-2.png)

In this step, the previous owner's iCloud account has been completely removed from the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, and the Activation Lock has also been removed.

### Method 2. Get the Previous Owner's Apple ID and Password

If you have an iPod and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max locked by iCloud, you'll need the previous owner's Apple ID and password to bypass the activation lock and use the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device. iCloud activation locks are put in place to protect your device and data, but if you've purchased a used iPod and Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max from someone who didn't remove their account information, you'll be stuck with a locked device.

### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost. Your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max should be iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6S, or 6S + to have the services of the iCloud activation lock. For phones on iOS 7 and above versions, the activation lock is auto-enabled once the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max is switched on.

### What is the iCloud activation lock used for?

An iCloud lock is basically for the security of an individual’s phone to not misuse and your details are safe. Once the 'Find My iPhone’ feature is enabled on your Apple devices, Apple’s activation server saves your Apple Id. Henceforth whenever your phone is turned off or performs any type of action such as erasing the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device or reactivating the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device, then your device will ask for unlocking iCloud activation.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max was iCloud activation locked?

If you are purchasing an iPhone or any other Apple device from someone, you need to make sure that the Apple device is no longer linked to the prior owner's account. To make sure you are on the safe side, you could check it for yourself. There are two ways to check:

1\. You can visit [https://icloud.com/activationlock](https://icloud.com/activationlock) from any Computer or MAC to check the present Activation Lock status of the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device.

2\. Follow the steps below to be sure that you can use your Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device hassle-free:

1) Switch on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device and slide to unlock it.

If the screen displays a passcode lock screen or you can see the Home Screen, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device you have purchased has not been erased. The seller will go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Ensure the seller clears the phone before he hands it over to you for use.

![erase all content and settings](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719307921421.jpg)

2) Set up your device.

Once you have selected the language, country, and connected to a network, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device will start activation. If the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device prompts you for the previous owner’s

Apple ID and password, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device is still linked to an earlier used account. You should go back to the seller and ask them to give you their password. If the previous owner of the Apple device cannot be located or is not present, the seller can try to remove the Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max device by going to [https://www.icloud.com/find](https://www.icloud.com/find).

![activate iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719308614183.jpg)

Once this is done, and your device prompts you for 'Set up our iPhone/iPad/iPod’ as you turn it on, then you know your device is ready for use.
