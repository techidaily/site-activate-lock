## Part 3: FAQs

### 1\. When Do We Require iCloud DNS Bypass?

We require it when our carrier locks our phone or when we buy a used phone and cannot use it because of an iCloud activation lock. The use of iCloud DNS bypass enables temporary access to the features and functionality of an iCloud-locked device. Domain Name Server, or DNS for short, serves the function of converting your domain names into IP addresses.

### 2\. What Can iCloud DNS Bypass Do for Us?

When you need an urgent functioning solution for a locked iPhone, using iCloud DNS bypass is helpful since it gives you temporary access to all the features and configuration of an iCloud-restricted device. DNS, or domain name server, converts your domain names into IP addresses.
