## How to Successfully Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro

An activation lock is a necessary feature of modern devices due to security breaches. It prevents your phone from getting used by the wrong hands. Consequently, it secures your data from getting exploited in case of theft.

However, it can be troublesome if you don't take enough care. Your phone can get stuck on the activation lock screen if you don't remember the password or have bought a second-hand device.

If your Apple iPhone 15 Pro is iCloud locked, there are ways to get it unlocked. We'll initially suggest reaching the seller. We will clear up the **Apple iPhone 15 Pro iCloud bypass** methods if you can't. So sit back and relax. This detailed guide explains how to perform **Apple iPhone 15 Pro iCloud bypass.**

## Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 15 Pro iCloud Activation Lock?

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner

Asking the owner about their Apple ID credentials is the first approach in this guide. You can disable the activation lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro when you get those. However, this technique isn't ensured to help you, as all of you realize that iCloud has individual data about the client.

Subsequently, no owner will want to give them to another person. In this way, you will be left without a response. It is a bad situation, so we could never propose you focus on this method for **Apple iPhone 15 Pro iCloud bypass**.

This method is best if the owner lives nearby, and you can meet face to face. In particular, they must know their Apple ID password. When you get together, request them to enter their Apple ID credentials, since they might be reluctant to share them via a call. It is very straightforward to remove their Apple ID and the activation lock.

![erase all content](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-5-5s-5c-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

- **Step 1.** When the activation lock screen appears, enter the Apple ID credentials.
- **Step 2.** After removing the activation lock, unpair any accessories connected to it.
- **Step 3.** Sign out of the App Store, iCloud, and iTunes.
- **Step 4.** At last, erase all content and settings by exploring the General menu from the Settings app. Click the Reset button for the “Erase All Content and Settings” option.

### 2\. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

Bypassing the Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro is easy if you know the Apple ID credentials that allow you to turn off the Find My feature. If you don't know about the Apple qualifications of the past owner, then the best free strategy is to utilize a DNS bypass. Here's what you need to do:

- **Step 1.** Turn on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro.
- **Step 2.** Select your language and area in the next step.
- **Step 3.** When asked to join a Wi-Fi network, tap on the “I” icon close to your Wi-Fi name.
