## Part 1: Basic information about iCloud lock

### What Does iCloud Lock Mean?

Part of the normal process of setting up a new iPhone is to register the phone with an Apple ID. Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 14 and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to [bypass the iCloud activation](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html) lock.

### What Does This Mean for You?

If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 14 device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 14 device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone 14 is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.

Now that you know everything you need to know about an iCloud-locked iPhone, read on to find out how to unlock an iCloud-locked iPhone.

## How To Bypass iCloud By Checkra1n Even On Apple iPhone 14 If You've Tried Everything

Since iOS 12.3, Apple has been using its new Activation Lock feature to deter theft. This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.

While this is a welcomed addition for those looking to protect their device, it can also be a major inconvenience for those who have lost or forgotten their iCloud password. Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information. You will learn in this post how to use Checkra1n iCloud bypass to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 or iPad.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: What is Checkra1n?

Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.

Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don't know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.

Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don't know the passcode.

**Pros**

- The tool doesn't require tech skills
- It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices
- Supports a wide range of hardware platforms
- It is not possible to exploit remotely

**Cons**

- Jailbreaking older devices is limited
- A reboot won't save them
