## Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max has an iCloud account lock on it?

If your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.

At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as [iCloud Activation Lock](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html). What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device's files, features, and functions.

This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy [a second-hand iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html) from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.

It doesn't matter what you do with your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max. Whether you [jailbreak](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html) it, [reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html) it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max.

If you cannot use your Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.

### Step 2. Unlocking iOS Devices: GSM and CDMA Activation Differences

Follow the prompt to connect your iOS device with a USB cable. Identify if your device is GSM or CDMA. After bypassing iCloud Activation Lock on a GSM device, it will work normally. However, for a CDMA device, calling and other cellular functions won't be available. As you continue unlocking the CDMA device, you'll receive step-by-step instructions. Choose the agreement option and click 'Got It!' to move forward.

### Step 3. Enabling DFU Mode on iOS Devices (Versions 15.0 to 16.3)

Afterward, if your Apple device hasn't undergone jailbreaking, the system will prompt the user to proceed with the process. Guidelines for jailbreaking are available in both written and video formats. For iOS/iPadOS versions 16.4 to 16.6, Dr.Fone is designed to perform the jailbreaking process automatically on your device.

Put iOS devices running versions 15.0 to 16.3 into DFU Mode following the on-screen instructions. After initiating DFU Mode for the first time, the program will command the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device to restart. Click the right arrow to proceed. Repeat the process to enter DFU Mode for the second time. Upon completion, the program will activate and unlock the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device. Once finished, select the "Got It!" button to complete the process.

### Step 4. Complete the Activation Lock Removal Process

After confirming your jailbroken iOS device, the process initiates automatically to remove the Activation Lock. Upon completion, a message confirming the finished process will be displayed on the screen. While the Apple iPhone 13 Pro Max device is in DFU Mode, the computer screen will show the progress of removing the iCloud **Mac Activation Lock**. Keep an eye on the progress bar until it reaches completion. Click the 'Done' button to finish unlocking the Activation Lock.
