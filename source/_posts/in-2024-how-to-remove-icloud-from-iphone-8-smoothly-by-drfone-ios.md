### 1\. What is Find My?

The Find My feature is an incredible method for keeping your Apple iPhone 8 from getting lost, as it permits you to find and lock it, regardless of whether you have it. For instance, when Find My iPhone is initiated, you can see where your Apple iPhone 8 is. You might use it to show your location to others or play a sound on your lost device, making it easier to find.
