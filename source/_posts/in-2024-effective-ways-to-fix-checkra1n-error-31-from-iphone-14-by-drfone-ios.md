## Apple iPhone 14 iCloud Activation Lock Bypass



The iCloud lock is an element intended to save your Apple iPhone 14 from missing, getting stolen, or being deleted. So, when you buy an iPhone, register it with an Apple ID, and set "Find My iPhone" to make it iCloud locked. That will make your device more secure.

However, each feature has its cons. It likewise can become problematic if you purchase a second-hand iPhone that is iCloud locked or fail to remember your iCloud details. You might end up staying with an iCloud lock screen. In such cases, you want to open an iCloud-locked device.

Therefore, this article will tell you the best **Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass** techniques. It has both quicker and more permanent solutions to **bypass Apple iPhone 14**. So, keep following this article until the end to find a permanent solution for your Apple iPhone 14.

## Part 1: What is iCloud Activation Lock in iPhone11/12?

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature implemented by Apple on Apple iPhone 14 and other iOS devices. It is designed to prevent unauthorized access to the Apple iPhone 14 device by linking it to the owner's Apple ID and iCloud account. When the Activation Lock is enabled, the Apple iPhone 14 device requires the owner's Apple ID and password to set up or restore the Apple iPhone 14 device, making it difficult for thieves to use or sell stolen iPhones. The Activation Lock ensures the Apple iPhone 14 device's data remains secure and can only be accessed by the rightful owner.

Regardless of whether you erase your device, Activation Lock can keep on preventing anybody from reactivating your device without your consent. Regardless of whether your device is stolen, the other person will require either your device password or your Apple ID credentials to use the phone. Even if they try resetting your device through DFU mode, they will not have the option to reactivate and utilize it without **Apple iPhone 14 iCloud unlock**.

However, it can create a problem for you if you're the second owner of this device. So, if you bought this phone from someone else, you must remove the lock first. In such cases, you will need **Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass.**

## Part 2: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 iCloud Activation Lock?

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature designed to protect iPhones from unauthorized use. However, if you find yourself with an Apple iPhone 14 locked with iCloud Activation, there are a few methods you can try to bypass the lock. In this article, we will explore three methods: contacting the previous device owner for Apple ID and password, requesting remote removal of the lock, and utilizing the iCloud DNS Bypass method. Let's dive into each method to help you regain access to your Apple iPhone 14.

### Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password

The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 14 and ask for their Apple ID and password. To **bypass Apple iPhone 14**, you need to have some data in hand:

- Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you're the second owner.
- If a device doesn't have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 14 passcode.

![enter icloud details](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 14 iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 14 device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.
- **Step 3:** Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.
- **Step 4:** Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.

However, if you see the Apple iPhone 14 passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 14 device without the iCloud account.

With the Apple iPhone 14 device set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.

### Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely

If the iPhone's first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it's time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.

However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.

So, if it's not a stolen device, you don't need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 14 device and **bypass Apple iPhone 14** by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.
- **Step 2:** Click the Apple iPhone 14 devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.
- **Step 3:** Pick your Apple iPhone 14 model from there.
- **Step 4:** Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked. It's as simple as that.

![remove or erase](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-2.jpg)

### Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device's features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 14, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.

**How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?**

A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 14 device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 14.

**Limitations of this Features**

When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn't true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.

The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.

- **Step 1:** When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.
- **Step 2.** Click "Proceed" to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect with Wi-Fi, search for the "I" icon near the Wi-Fi tab.
- **Step 3.** Disconnect the Wi-Fi, go to "Connection Settings," and snap "Forget this Network."
- **Step 4.** Click the "I" icon and enter a DNS server IP address. You can browse the IP addresses below:

![dns bypass](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-3.jpg)

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219

- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other regions: 78.100.17.60

- **Step 5.** Presently, click the "Back" choice on the left half of your screen, turn on Wi-Fi, select your network from there, and enter your code.

![activate iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-4.jpg)

- **Step 6.** Click "Next Page" and snap "Back" to enter the iCloud bypass screen.
- **Step 7.** Your device will unlock, and you can access all its features now.
