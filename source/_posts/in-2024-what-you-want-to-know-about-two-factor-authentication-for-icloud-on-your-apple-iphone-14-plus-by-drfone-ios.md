## Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you're wondering how to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud, the answer is no, you can't. However, if you don't have access to your trusted device, you can have a code sent to your trusted phone number via an SMS or an automated phone call to prove to Apple that you own the iCloud account.

If this is impossible, you should request [account recovery](https://iforgot.apple.com/) to regain access to your account.

The easiest way to prevent this issue is by adding another phone number to your Apple ID so you'll always have a backup. Here's how.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, go to **Settings** and tap on your **Apple ID** > **Password & Security**.

**Step 2**: Tap **Edit** and choose to **Add a Trusted Phone Number**. You'll have to enter your device's passcode to continue.

![add trusted phone number apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/add-trusted-phone-number-icloud.jpg)

**Step 3**: Enter your new phone number. Select a way to receive a verification code via sms or phone call and tap **Send**.

**Step 4**: Enter the verification code and wait for the process to finish.

## How to Unlock iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus and iPad?

## Part 1: Is it possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone

At the start of 2014, apple introduced what they call "iCloud Activation Lock". This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don't have the credentials using third-party software.

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner

For an **Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass**, you'll require a couple of significant pieces of data:

- Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.
- If a device doesn't have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone 14 Plus passcode in mind.

![owners apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus.
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.
- **Step 3:** Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.
- **Step 4:** Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.
