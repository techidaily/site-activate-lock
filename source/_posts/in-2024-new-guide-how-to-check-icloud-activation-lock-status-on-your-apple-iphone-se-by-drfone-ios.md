It’s a way to ensure that only the rightful owner can use and access the Apple iPhone SE device. Originally designed as a theft deterrent, the iCloud Activation Lock on used Apple Devices becomes especially important when buying or selling second-hand phones.

![iphone activation lock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-01.jpg)

## Part 1: How To Check Activation Lock Status Before You Buy a Used Device

Understanding the iCloud Activation Lock is essential when purchasing a used Apple device. This security feature, designed by Apple, is activated when ‘Find My iPhone’ is enabled. It links the Apple iPhone SE device to the owner’s Apple ID, preventing others from activating it without the owner’s permission. This lock is crucial for preventing unauthorized use of lost or stolen devices.

Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, **checking the iCloud Activation Lock status** is important. Here’s how:

- **Step 1:** Power on the Apple iPhone SE device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone SE device has been properly erased.

![iphone lockscreen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg)

****Note:**** **If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone SE device still needs to be fully erased. In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone SE device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.**

- **Step 2:** Start setting up the Apple iPhone SE device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone SE device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.
- **Step 3:** During the setup, if the Apple iPhone SE device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone SE device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone SE device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.

If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an **activation lock check** when buying second-hand phones.

## Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices

If you’re planning to sell your Apple iPhone SE or are curious about the status of a lost phone, you should also perform an **iCloud lock check**. This feature, crucial for security, can prevent a new user from accessing the phone without your permission. Here’s how you can check the status:

### Method 1: Check Within the Phone

The first way to check your devices’ iCloud activation lock status is through the Apple iPhone SE devices themselves. There are two ways to do this, as presented in this section.

#### Method 1.1: Navigating to the Settings App

First, open Settings on your iDevice. At the top of its menu, tap on your profile name.

If you see an iCloud account listed here and you’re signed in, your device is still linked to that iCloud account. Thus, it will still be under the iCloud Activation Lock. If there is no iCloud activation lock, it should look like this:

![iphone no icloud lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-03.jpg)

#### Method 1.2: Check During Phone Activation

If you are setting up the phone afresh or after a factory reset, proceed with the initial setup steps. Suppose the Apple iPhone SE device asks for an Apple ID and password previously associated with the Apple iPhone SE device at any point during the setup. In that case, it indicates that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active. This occurs if the Apple iPhone SE device was not correctly erased before the reset.

### Method 2: Using IMEI Number

Every iPhone or iPad has its own IMEI number. It can be used to check details about the Apple iPhone SE device remotely, including **checking the iCloud Activation Lock**. Here are the steps to use your IMEI number to **check the iCloud Activation Lock status** of your phone using third-party apps:

- **Step 1:** Open your **Settings** app on the iDevice.
- **Step 2:** Go to **General**, then choose **About.**
- **Step 3:** Find the **IMEI** number by scrolling down. It’s a 15-digit number that’s unique to your device.

![imei page iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-04.jpg)

- **Step 4:** Several third-party websites offer services to check iCloud Activation Lock status using the IMEI number. Some of these services are free, while others might charge a small fee. Make sure to use a reputable service to avoid scams.
- **Step 5:** On the chosen service’s website, enter your device’s IMEI number.
- **Step 6:** The service will provide details regarding the iCloud activation lock status.

Remember, if selling, always erase your device and sign out of iCloud to remove the activation lock. For buyers, always ensure your device is free from previous iCloud accounts.

## Part 3: How To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

If you discover that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active on your iOS device, removing it is crucial, especially if you plan to sell or repurpose it. There are a few methods to do this, depending on whether you have physical access to the phone.

## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

![jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg)

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone SE device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone SE device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.
