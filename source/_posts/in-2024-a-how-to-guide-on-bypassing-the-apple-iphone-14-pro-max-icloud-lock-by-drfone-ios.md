## Part 1: 4 Efficient Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max iCloud Activation Lock

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner

For an **Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max iCloud bypass**, you'll require a couple of significant pieces of data:

- Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.

![owners apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.

- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
