## Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password

If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device, learning **how to remove iCloud Activation Lock** is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.

## Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud Activation Lock?

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner

Asking the owner about their Apple ID credentials is the first approach in this guide. You can disable the activation lock on your Apple iPhone 14 Plus when you get those. However, this technique isn't ensured to help you, as all of you realize that iCloud has individual data about the client.

Subsequently, no owner will want to give them to another person. In this way, you will be left without a response. It is a bad situation, so we could never propose you focus on this method for **Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud bypass**.

This method is best if the owner lives nearby, and you can meet face to face. In particular, they must know their Apple ID password. When you get together, request them to enter their Apple ID credentials, since they might be reluctant to share them via a call. It is very straightforward to remove their Apple ID and the activation lock.

- **Check Cellular or Network Connectivity in Settings**

Navigate to your Apple iPhone 14 Plus’s Settings menu. Head to “Cellular” or “Mobile Data” and ensure it’s switched on. A lit icon signals active connectivity. If using Wi-Fi, look for the Wi-Fi symbol at the top – a strong connection is a green light for activation success.
