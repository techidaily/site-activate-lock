## How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad?

Apple has long been famous for providing sound devices, with nifty safety and user-friendly features. With that said, if you just purchased a used iOS device, you may be required to bypass the activation lock on your device using iCloud, or the previous user’s account. Before we take a look at how to bypass an activation lock on an Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad, let’s examine what an activation lock on an Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad entails.

![bypass activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/bypass-activation-lock.jpg)

## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad?

This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery. Without access to the owner’s Apple ID and/or password, accessing the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device becomes impossible. Unfortunately for used purchases, you may have procured a used item legitimately, but have no access to said device.

This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 15 Pro. Knowing the activation lock is enabled on an Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad is easy, as the screen prompts you to input a user ID and password.

## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

Using a valid Apple ID and password is the easiest way to bypass the activation lock on Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad Mini. In any case, if you legitimately purchased the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device from the previous owner, they should have no qualms giving you these details. If it’s a new device, and you are the original owner, you will have this information ready to use for activation. Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad Mini.

![add apple id password](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2020/11/add-apple-id-password.jpg)

- **Step 1.** Have the previous owner enter their details on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad Mini, or request them to send the same to you.
- **Step 2.** Fire up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device and when prompted on the Activation Lock Screen, enter the Apple ID and password.
- **Step 3.** Within a few minutes, the home screen should appear on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad.
- **Step 4.** Upon reaching this page, navigate to the settings tab to sign out of iCloud.

_**A note for users before we proceed with the bypass steps:**  
Users on iOS 12 or earlier can locate this option on settings, navigating to iCloud, then signing out. For iOS 13 or later, click on settings, then your name, and sign out._

- **Step 5.** Chances are, the Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad will prompt you to enter the original user’s ID and Password. Simply enter the details available to you.
- **Step 6.** Finally, the best part of the unlocking process; navigate to the settings tab to erase all data. Open up settings, click reset and proceed to erase all content, including settings.
- **Step 7.** At this point, your Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad will restart/reboot, allowing you to set up the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device anew.

There are a few web-based resources and tricks that facilitate this procedure. Suffice to say, these methods, known as Jailbreaking, do not work when activation lock is enabled. Stick to using credible methods like the one listed above. Alternatively, you can use iCloud to bypass the Apple iPhone 15 Pro or iPad Mini activation lock.

## How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Pro and iPad

There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.

With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.

## Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple

In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.

#### **Step 1:** Enter your Login Details

To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.

#### **Step 2:** Find My iPhone

Once you have gained access to your device, locate the "Find My iPhone" option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It's also the main reason why you can't access your iCloud account.

#### **Step 3:** Restore your Device

With the "Find My iPhone" option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings> General> Reset> Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.

#### **Step 4:** Sign In

With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.

## Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner

Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device happens to be the real owner, then he/she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.

This approach, however, has a downside. It's only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.

## Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock

One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the [Official iPhoneUnlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare). With the help of the iCloud Activation Lock Removal process, you can easily bypass the iCloud Activation Lock and remove it completely from your device. The following is a detailed process on how you can seamlessly do it with the peace of mind that your data and all valuable information will be kept in place.

#### **Step 1:** Purchase the Service

For you to unlock the iCloud lock, using this method, you first have to obtain the rights to do so. Securing these rights is simply done by purchasing their services. The price at which you’ll be charged will depend on the model of your device. To buy these services, visit [the webiste](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) of Official iPhoneUnlock and select "iCloud Unlock" to its "iCloud Unlock/Activation Lock Removal" feature, then enter your IMEI number from the drop-down list as illustrated below. Once you have located your phone make or model, click on the "Add to Cart" tab. The price at which you are going to be charged will be displayed on your right-hand side.

![fix icloud lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719794951413.jpg)

#### **Step 2:** Enter your Email Address

A new page with your purchase details as shown below will open up. Enter your email address as requested and click on the "Continue" button. Make sure that you have entered the correct email address as it will be used to inform you that your iCloud lock is no longer active.

![how to fix icloud lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719796268564.jpg)

#### **Step 3:** Pay Options

Once you have entered your email address, a new interface requesting you to choose your preferred payment method will be displayed. Choose your best-preferred method by clicking on the "Pay with Credit or Debit Card" tab and enter your bank details. Once you submit your payment, your iCloud lock will be unlocked after a period of between 2-3 days. A confirmation email will be sent to your designated email address. Just like that, your iCloud lock fix is removed, and you are free to use iCloud.
