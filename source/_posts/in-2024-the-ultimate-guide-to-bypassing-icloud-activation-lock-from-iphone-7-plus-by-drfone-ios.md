## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone 7 Plus device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13/.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.

If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.

## Conclusion

From the methods mentioned above, it’s easy to see that it only takes a matter of days to unlock the iCloud account or to completely remove the stubborn iCloud lock. The diversity of both methods allows you to easily pick and use the best method that suits your preferences. Regardless of whether you want to download iCloud remover, or you simply want to go for an easy-to-use and pocket-friendly online platform, the fact remains that both of these methods have got you covered.

The iCloud unlocker download method though effective requires a lot of time to go through it and don’t forget the amount of money used to get it working. On the other hand, what I like about our second method is the fact that it's more efficient and easy to use. With it, I don't have to go through the tiring and complex downloading process, since the company itself bypasses the lock and renders My Apple iPhone 7 Plus usable.
