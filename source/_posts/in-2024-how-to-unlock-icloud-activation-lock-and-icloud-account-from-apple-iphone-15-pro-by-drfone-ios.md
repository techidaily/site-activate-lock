### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 15 Pro, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone 15 Pro was iCloud activation locked?

2\. Follow the steps below to be sure that you can use your Apple iPhone 15 Pro device hassle-free:

1) Switch on the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device and slide to unlock it.
