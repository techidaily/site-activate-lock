## 3 Effective Ways to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Pro

Ever since the launch of the first iPhone, both iPhone and Apple have seen tremendous growth year after year on account of the new features and capabilities Apple continues to add to the iPhone. Apple has placed the Apple iPhone 14 Pro as a coveted product, somehow it transcends the feelings of having a smartphone and becomes something special. A lot of it is Apple marketing at work, but the marketers have had great products to work with, too.

Over time, Apple added something called Activation Lock to its devices to deter theft, since, you guessed it, Apple devices are a prime target for thieves. What is Activation Lock? Chances are, if you are reading this article, you are stuck at it, and want to know what to do to bypass Activation Lock on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro. We start with a little primer on Activation Lock to give you a better understanding of what it is.

## Part 1: Activation Lock Primer

Apple products are costly, and they are prized. When a 5-year-old Android device might be left alone without anyone stealing it, you cannot risk that with an iPhone 6S, even today. Apple has built an Activation Lock in its devices to deter theft and so far, as we know, it has largely succeeded. If your Apple iPhone 14 Pro gets stolen, no one else can use it with their Apple ID unless they key in the credentials it was using previously (your credentials) and, even then, Apple has bolstered iCloud Find My Activation Lock to be more restrictive. You may have to key in a lot of information ranging from your device password (if you are also using the same Apple ID on a Mac) to your iOS device passcode too, obviously, your Apple ID password. It is a system that works in favor of Apple users.

Yet, in some cases, users want to get around the Activation Lock for genuine reasons, say, when you buy a used Apple device from someone. They may have forgotten to remove that device from their Apple account and Activation Lock would not let you use it. Or, you are an IT administrator, and you manage devices given out to employees. Some employees did not remove their accounts from their devices, and now those iPhones are riddled with Activation Lock. You can remove it using this step-by-step guide.

## Part 2: Bypassing Activation Lock using official methods (Apple iPhone 14 Pro)

An Activation Lock is not the end of the world, as Apple might have you believe. Nothing in the world is perfect, except for the world itself. As such, there are ways to bypass Activation Lock on an Apple device that you bought used, and the previous owner forgot to unlock or did so intentionally and is now trying to fleece you for more money to unlock it. Or an employee who just left the job surrendered their iPhone but forgot to erase the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device before submitting and consequently, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is still associated with their Apple ID, and you need to bypass Activation Lock for that Apple iPhone 14 Pro to make it useable again. There are a few ways you can go about it.

### Method 1. Bypassing Activation Lock Using Apple ID

Disabling Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Pro is easy if you have the Apple ID credentials that are associated with the iPhone.

![activation lock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-13-1-1.jpg)

- Step 1: Enter device Recovery Mode and Restore the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device to factory settings.
- Step 2: When you set up the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device again, you will be required to sign in to the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. Do that and you are golden!

### Method 2. Bypassing Activation Lock from iCloud Website

You may also do away with Activation Lock using the Find My iPhone app in iCloud remotely by erasing the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device and removing the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device from the associated iCloud account.

- Step 1: Visit the iCloud website on a computer at <https://icloud.com>.
- Step 2: Sign In and go to Find iPhone.

![find iphone option in icloud](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-13-2.jpg)

- Step 3: Click All Devices and select the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device that was sold to the user.
- Step 4: Click Erase iPhone and if the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device is still there after the erase is complete, click Remove From Account.

![erase iphone and bypass activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-on-iphone-13-3.jpg)

This process requires that the data service be functional on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro in question, otherwise, this will not work. When the process is done, restart the Apple iPhone 14 Pro and set it up with your Apple ID to remove the lock.

### Method 3. Bypassing Activation Lock Using Microsoft Intune

If you are an IT administrator and are using Microsoft services, you may have given employees iPhones. When employees leave or are made to leave, it is possible that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro devices they leave behind are still signed in with a password only they know. There is a way Apple provides for Microsoft Intune to disable Activation Lock for corporate devices.

![what is microsoft intune](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/10/what-is-intune.png)

- Step 1: Sign in to the admin center on Microsoft Endpoint Manager.
- Step 2: Select Devices under Intune.
- Step 3: Select All Devices.
- Step 4: Locate the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device you want to disable the lock for, and under the Hardware section, copy the Activation Lock Bypass Code given under Conditional Access.
- Step 5: Under the Overview pane of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, select Wipe.
- Step 6: When the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device resets, it prompts for the Apple ID and password. Leave the ID blank and enter the bypass code as a password.

The device will be reset, and employees can set it up again with a new Apple ID.

## Latest Guide on iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 14 Pro iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

Nowadays, many purchase a used iPhone instead of a fresh, out-of-the-box new one. Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.

It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials. However, we've discovered a few potential ways to **bypass iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 14 Pro**. Also, we will introduce you to the best and expert bypass tool available in the market. Therefore, we strongly suggest you stay with us and download Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock. It is safe during the process. So, how about we begin?

Explore four practical methods to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock on your iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 14 Pro. These solutions help you regain access to your device and its features, enabling you to enjoy your iPad without any restrictions.

### Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner

The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To **bypass iPad 3** activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.

However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device.

**Step 2.** On your iPad, go to the "Settings" application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.

- If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to "iCloud" and sign out.
- If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click "Sign Out."

![sign out](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/ipad-2-3-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

**Step 3.** It will request the password to your Apple account. Enter it and turn the iPad off. When done, you will not go over the activation lock screen again, and that's how you **bypass iPad 2** activation lock.

### Method 2. Ask the previous owner for the lock removal

If the previous owner failed to do this before selling the iPad to you, this shouldn't cause an issue. But it might be a problem if they have sold you a stolen phone and don't have the remotest clue about the Apple ID.

You don't need to worry about the iPad activation lock if it's a genuine phone. The past user can remotely wipe out the iPad Apple account without having the phone in their control by following these steps:

**Step 1.** Explore the appleid.apple.com site from a web browser and sign in with your Apple ID details.

When you give this to Apple, they can confirm the first owner of the phone and afterward can assist you with the **iPad 2 iCloud bypass**. After confirmation of purchase, they might request different documents, like one of your ID cards.

If you purchased the phone from your family member or somebody who has died, then your other choice to remove the lock is to show their death certificate to Apple. Apple will then, at that point, check the files and could unlock the iPad for you.

In the two cases, it depends on Apple to conclude whether they are happy with your files and if they might want to **bypass iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 14 Pro** lock.

## Part 3: FAQs

### What is an activation lock?

It is a component intended to prevent any other individual from utilizing your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, iPad, or iPod contact, once it's consistently lost or taken. Activation Lock turns on naturally when you turn on the Find My feature on your device.

### Can I remove the activation lock by hard reset?

A hard reset doesn't remove the activation lock from the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. For instance, if a phone is hard reset with the Google account signed in, the phone will, in any case, request you to enter the account credentials once turned back on.
