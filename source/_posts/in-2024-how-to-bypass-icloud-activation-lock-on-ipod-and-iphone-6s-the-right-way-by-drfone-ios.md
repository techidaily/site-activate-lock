## Part 2: 5 Easy Methods to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on iPod and Apple iPhone 6s

The most common question is how to bypass the iCloud activation lock on their iPhones, iPads, or iPod and Apple iPhone 6s touches. While you can use several methods to achieve this, we've compiled a list of five of the most effective ones below.

### Method 1. Make the Previous Owner Remove It Remotely

If you have a personal relationship with the previous owner of the iOS device, you might be able to ask them to help you remove the Find My iPhone Activation Lock remotely using iCloud.com:

**Step 1.** Sign in to iCloud using your Apple ID and password by going to the official website.

**Step 2.** You can select the associated device by clicking All Devices at the top of the screen.

**Step 3.** You can erase the Apple iPhone 6s device by clicking "Erase \[device\]".

**Step 4.** Last but not least, click "Remove from the account".

![remove activation lock on ipod](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/bypass-ipod-activation-lock-2.png)

In this step, the previous owner's iCloud account has been completely removed from the Apple iPhone 6s device, and the Activation Lock has also been removed.

### Method 2. Get the Previous Owner's Apple ID and Password

If you have an iPod and Apple iPhone 6s locked by iCloud, you'll need the previous owner's Apple ID and password to bypass the activation lock and use the Apple iPhone 6s device. iCloud activation locks are put in place to protect your device and data, but if you've purchased a used iPod and Apple iPhone 6s from someone who didn't remove their account information, you'll be stuck with a locked device.

### Method 3. DNS Bypass

To remove the iCloud Activation Lock iPod and Apple iPhone 6s from the Apple iPhone 6s device, you can use a DNS server or HTML. When you have no other choice, it's worth a shot. Please note that this method only works with newer versions of iOS, such as iOS 10.

**Step 1:** Start the Apple iPhone 6s device or restart it if it is already on.

**Step 2:** Select "Choose Wi-Fi network" during the setup process.

**Step 3:** Click "More Wi-Fi Settings" and tap the "I" icon next to the Wi-Fi network.

**Step 4:** Click "Configure DNS" and choose "Manual".

**Step 5:** Select "+Add Server" and enter the server's address at your location. Use the following server addresses:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Africa, Australia, and other locations: 78.109.17.60

**Step 6:** After tapping "Save", click on the back option and select "Ask to Join Networks".

**Step 7:** Enter the network password and then tap "Join".

**Step 8:** To set up the Apple iPhone 6s device normally, tap on the back button when it tries to activate.

## Part 1: Basic information about iCloud lock

### What Does iCloud Lock Mean?

Part of the normal process of setting up a new iPhone is to register the phone with an Apple ID. Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 6s and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to [bypass the iCloud activation](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html) lock.

### What Does This Mean for You?

If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 6s device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 6s device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone 6s is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.

Now that you know everything you need to know about an iCloud-locked iPhone, read on to find out how to unlock an iCloud-locked iPhone.

If you’re the original user of the iPhone, and you think it’s unfair to shell out extra money to unlock an iPhone that should already be unlocked, then you can visit the Apple Store. You may have forgotten your iCloud details, which include your Apple ID or your password. To get your details back, you can visit the Apple Store and follow the steps to retrieve your details. If you bought an iPhone from a seller, endeavor to ask them if it’s a second-hand iPhone and get the right details from the user.

This might seem like an easy solution. However, it is quite difficult and time-consuming. Apple is extremely difficult about its security. As such, you’ll have to be the original owner of the iPhone, and you’ll need to have all your details if you want to be able to carry out this method.

Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6s.

In this article, I'm going to painstakingly elaborate two (2) unique methods that you can use to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. The jailbreaking method you chose will depend on your preferences.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?

Many people have always asked me if it's possible to remove the iCloud lock with a jailbreak method. Well, the answer to this simple technological question is a definite NO, as we have seen in the introduction section, jailbreaking functions by removing any form of software (s) that may be restricting you from fully accessing your iDevice, but not removing the iCloud lock. In simple terms, jailbreaking will unlock your phone only after the lock has been removed by another method.

## Part 2: Contact the Previous iPhone Owner

This method is only applicable to those people who bought the Apple iPhone 6s from a second-hand shop or from a friend. If you bought an iCloud locked iPhone from a friend, the first thing you have to do is to contact them. In most cases, the seller is usually available to help you jailbreak the locked iPhone. Once you get in touch with the previous owner, ask them to follow the following steps to unlock the iCloud locked iPhone.

Sign in to the iCloud account> Go to "Find My Apple iPhone 6s"> Select each and every device under this tab> click "Erase iPhone." Up to this point, any information present in the phone will be deleted. Since we want to remove the previous account completely, we'll proceed to the next step, which is to click the "Next" tab. Once we've done this, a new tab with "Remove Account" will emerge. Click on it to completely remove the previous iCloud account details.

### Visit an Authorised Apple Store

You can jailbreak your locked iPhone by getting help from an authorized Apple specialist. The catch of using this method is the fact that you should be the original owner of the iPhone. What you need is your ID and the warranty if it's still valid. As long as you have the required documents, these specialists will jailbreak your locked iPhone in a matter of minutes.

## Part 3: How to Jailbreak iPhone

You can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6s device with the help of a jailbreaking software such as Pangu. Pangu gives you the opportunity to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6s and render it free for use. The following is a detailed step by step guide on how you can jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6s.

![start to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/09/14736112213161.jpg)
