In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

Regardless of whether you delete your device remotely, the activation lock can keep on stopping anybody from reactivating your device without your consent.

However, you should keep the Find My feature enabled. Also, it would help if you remember your Apple ID credentials.

With WatchOS 2, the activation lock can safeguard your Apple Watch. What's more, macOS Catalina or later and Mac PCs with the Apple T2 or Apple Silicon chip can utilize the activation lock to keep your computer safe.

**2\. Can all iPad/iPod/Apple Watch/Mac activation locks be bypassed?**

As mentioned above, one can remove the activation lock with a few simple steps. Moreover, if none of these methods work, Dr.Fone is still there for the rescue. You can use their advanced tools to unlock all locks on your Apple iPhone SE, iPad, iPod, or Apple watches.

**3\. How to turn off Find My?**

- Open the Apple iPhone SE Settings and tap your name.
- Explore “Find My” and go to "Find My iPhone".
- If Find My iPhone is enabled, the toggle button on top of the page should be green. Switch the button to turn it off.
- Enter your Mac ID password to confirm, and you're ready.
