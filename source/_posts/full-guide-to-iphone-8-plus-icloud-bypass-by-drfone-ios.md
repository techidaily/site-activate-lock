It links the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device to the owner’s Apple ID, preventing others from activating it without the owner’s permission. This lock is crucial for preventing unauthorized use of lost or stolen devices.

Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, **checking the iCloud Activation Lock status** is important. Here’s how:

- **Step 1:** Power on the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device has been properly erased.

![iphone lockscreen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg)

****Note:**** **If you’re greeted with the passcode Lock Screen or the Home Screen, it indicates that the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device still needs to be fully erased. In this case, ask the seller to completely erase the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device before proceeding. It’s important to only take ownership of any used Apple device once it has been erased.**

- **Step 2:** Start setting up the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.
- **Step 3:** During the setup, if the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device is still linked to the account. Hand the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device back to the seller and request them to enter their password.

If the previous owner is absent, ask them to remove their iCloud account from the phone through a web browser. This step is vital. Remember, always perform an **activation lock check** when buying second-hand phones.

## Part 2: How To Check the iCloud Activation Lock Status of Your Devices
