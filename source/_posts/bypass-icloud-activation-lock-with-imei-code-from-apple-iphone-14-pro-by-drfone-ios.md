## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

**Method 3:** For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you're on the “General” tab, then select "Phone Number" below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

The Official iPhone Unlock method happens to be the best unlock iCloud lock method that requires no software whatsoever to bypass the iCloud lock. With this method, all you need is an active internet connection, your unique IMEI number, a valid payment option and your Apple iPhone 14 Pro or iPad make or model. You only need to spend about £19.99 ($27.00) to get your iCloud lock bypassed, unlike in our first method. The waiting period usually varies from one device to another. However, the optimum time falls between 1-3 business days.

### How to bypass iCloud Activation Lock

#### **Step 1:** Visit Official iPhone Unlock Website

Visit [Official iPhoneUnlock website](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) and select "iCloud Unlock".

#### **Step 2:** Add Contact Details

Once you have clicked on the “Add to Cart” icon, a new page with an email option under the “Contact Details” will open up. Add your valid email address in the space provided. Be sure to insert a valid email, as it will be used to communicate with you the moment your Apple iPhone 14 Pro iCloud Lock has been bypassed.

#### **Step 3:** Pay Options

With your valid email submitted, you will be requested to enter your payment details. Simply choose between Visa, MasterCard, and American Express and click on the “Pay with Credit or Debit Card” icon. Once you have confirmed your payments details, a confirmation email will be sent to your designated email address. After three (3) business days, you’ll receive an email confirming that the iCloud lock has been bypassed successfully. From that point, you can comfortably use your device as you please.

## Conclusion

From the methods mentioned above, it’s easy to see that it only takes a matter of days to unlock the iCloud account or to completely remove the stubborn iCloud lock. The diversity of both methods allows you to easily pick and use the best method that suits your preferences. Regardless of whether you want to download iCloud remover, or you simply want to go for an easy-to-use and pocket-friendly online platform, the fact remains that both of these methods have got you covered.

The iCloud unlocker download method though effective requires a lot of time to go through it and don’t forget the amount of money used to get it working. On the other hand, what I like about our second method is the fact that it's more efficient and easy to use. With it, I don't have to go through the tiring and complex downloading process, since the company itself bypasses the lock and renders My Apple iPhone 14 Pro usable.
