## Latest Guide on iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 6 iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

Nowadays, many purchase a used iPhone instead of a fresh, out-of-the-box new one. Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 6 device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 6 device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.

It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials. However, we've discovered a few potential ways to **bypass iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 6**. Also, we will introduce you to the best and expert bypass tool available in the market. Therefore, we strongly suggest you stay with us and download Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock.

Explore four practical methods to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock on your iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 6. These solutions help you regain access to your device and its features, enabling you to enjoy your iPad without any restrictions.

### Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner

The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To **bypass iPad 3** activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 6 device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.

However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 6 device.

**Step 2.** On your iPad, go to the "Settings" application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.

- If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to "iCloud" and sign out.
- If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click "Sign Out."

#### How to Jailbreak on Windows and Mac

Jailbreak on Mac and Windows should be the first thing you need to do when you are going to **bypass the Activation Lock**. As we know, many available tools in the market are not compatible with it. You should know what needs to be prepared before you jailbreak on Windows and Mac.

##### [Jailbreak on Windows](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-windows.html)

The first thing you need to make sure of is that your computer runs on version 7 or above, and you have a USB flash drive with 2 GB capacity. After that, download the "[checkn1x-amd64.iso](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/checkn1x-amd64.iso)" and "[WinRa1n2.0](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=10620683726822078150)."

##### [Jailbreak on Mac](https://drfone.wondershare.com/guide/how-to-jailbreak-ios-on-mac.html)

To jailbreak iOS on Mac, download the "[Checkra1n](https://checkra.in/releases/0.12.4-beta#all-downloads)" and then simply try to connect the Mac computer and the iOS device using a USB cable.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Bypass Activation Lock

There are some steps that you need to follow in order to **bypass the Activation Lock** using Wondershare Dr.Fone. These steps are:

**Step 1: Install and Download Dr.Fone, and Select Remove Active Lock**

On your computer system, install and download Wondershare Dr.Fone and hit the “Screen Unlock” module from the main interface. Now go to the “Unlock Apple ID” option and then choose “Remove Active Lock".

**Step 2: Jailbreak and Confirm Device Information**

Now jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6, and once it is done, a warning message will appear on the screen. You need to “Tick” the confirmation statement that you agree with the terms and conditions and click on the “Next” button. You are also required to confirm the information, like the Apple iPhone 6 device model.
