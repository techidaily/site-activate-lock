## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Pro or iPad?

This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery.

It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 14 Pro.

## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Pro or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

If it’s a new device, and you are the original owner, you will have this information ready to use for activation. Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 14 Pro or iPad Mini.
