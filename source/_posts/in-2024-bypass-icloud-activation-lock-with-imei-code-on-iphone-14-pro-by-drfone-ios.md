### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 14 Pro device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![check IMEI code on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg)

**Method 2:** Click the "Device" icon in iTunes to access the "Summary" tab. To find the IMEI number on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro, tap "Phone Number" under your device name or navigate to the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device model.

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 14 Pro device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

### 3\. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone

For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.

## How to Unlock iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro and iPad?

## Part 1: Is it possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone

At the start of 2014, apple introduced what they call "iCloud Activation Lock". This means that your iPad, iPhone, or Apple Watch is now locked to your iCloud account unless you decide to share your login details with someone. Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don't have the credentials using third-party software.
