**Step 4: Reset All Settings**

You will now see the instructions on the screen. Follow those on your device to reset all settings. Reboot the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device right after this.

**Step 5:** **_Remove iCloud Lock_**

Upon the restarting of the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device, Dr.Fone will start to **_remove the iCloud lock,_** and you just need to wait till the process gets completed.

From the methods mentioned above, we can comfortably conclude that it's easy to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone. Regardless of the method you choose, jailbreaking a locked phone is as easy as formatting one, as long as the restrictive iCloud lock has been removed by a previous method, such as the one mentioned in part 3
