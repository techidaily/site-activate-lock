## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 13 mini or iPad?

This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery.

This feature is enabled by default when the Find My Apple iPhone 13 mini option is selected on an iOS device. It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 13 mini.
