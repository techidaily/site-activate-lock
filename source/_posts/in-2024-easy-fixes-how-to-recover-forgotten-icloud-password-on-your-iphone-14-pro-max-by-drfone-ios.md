## Part 2: What is Find My?

By all accounts, Apple's Find My feature does what it says. If you lose your Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max, you can recognize its latest area using the iCloud Site, and you can make it play a sound.

Yet, Find My iPhone does substantially more! You can utilize it to find a missing Macintosh, iPad, iPod, and even AirPods. It also safeguards your data on the off chance a gadget is stolen. It even works with Family Sharing to find phones claimed by anybody in your family.

## Part 3: How to Disable Find My?

When you switch off Find My feature on your iDevice, the Activation Lock is naturally switched off. Here's how:

- Go to Settings, click on your account (your account name) and click the "Find My" option on your iDevice.
