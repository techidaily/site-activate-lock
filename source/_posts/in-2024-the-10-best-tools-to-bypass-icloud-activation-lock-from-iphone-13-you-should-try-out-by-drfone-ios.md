**Note:** After you turn off the Find My iPhone services, the Activation Lock is automatically disabled.

## Part 3. Remove find my iPhone with Apple support

Another approach that can be taken into consideration is by accessing Apple Support. Contacting Apple Support can be listed as one of the most prolific and conventional methods adopted to retrieve credentials and remove appropriate services readily consumed. However, to enjoy such easy services, you need to have a claim over the Apple iPhone 13 device. It would be both horrendous and confusing to contact Support if you have not had any control over the Apple iPhone 13 device in the past years. This method might be quite easy and cost less to execute; however, you cannot cover Apple devices bought through secondhand vendors. Furthermore, by following the steps described, it is up to the Support to decide on the case and provide you with appropriate results. Few details need to be covered before contacting the Support. By calling them, they would require the following details, at most.

- The Apple AppleCare agreement number
- The device’s serial number
- The phone’s receipt

By providing the following details, Apple Support may help you remove the Find My iPhone across your device and helps you configure your device easily.

## Part 4. Is it possible to remove the activation lock if it's a secondhand iPhone?

Normally, it is up to the previous user with his Apple ID to provide you with the appropriate credentials to remove the activation lock across the Apple iPhone 13 device. For such cases, you need to contact the user himself and explain the reasons for coming up with such a situation. One easy way of confirming the credentials is by going to the locality of the user himself. With this, the phone is just a restart away, followed by the standard activation procedures that would help you remove the Activation Lock across your device.

It isn't easy to follow these steps if you do not own the Apple iPhone 13 device and can't contact the owner. Under such circumstances, you have to use a third-party program. [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) is one of the best programs to remove an iCloud activation lock.
