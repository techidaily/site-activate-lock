## Part 1: Basic knowledge about iCloud activation lock

### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 6s, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost. Your Apple iPhone 6s should be iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6S, or 6S + to have the services of the iCloud activation lock.

Once the 'Find My iPhone’ feature is enabled on your Apple devices, Apple’s activation server saves your Apple Id. Henceforth whenever your phone is turned off or performs any type of action such as erasing the Apple iPhone 6s device or reactivating the Apple iPhone 6s device, then your device will ask for unlocking iCloud activation.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone 6s was iCloud activation locked?
