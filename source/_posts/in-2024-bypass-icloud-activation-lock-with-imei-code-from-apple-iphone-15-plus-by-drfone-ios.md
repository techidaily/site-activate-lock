## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

**Step 6.** Click "Next Page" and tap the "Back" button to enter the iCloud bypass screen.

**Step 7.** You can now set up your applications and utilize your device.

### Method 4. Seek Help from Apple Support

If there are no choices for contacting the past owner of the iPad, you can ask Apple backing to assist you with the **iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 15 Plus iCloud bypass**. That may not be a simple process, but if you have the expected documents (for individuals who got verification of the purchase from the seller), Apple will be willing to help you.

One way to bypass the Find My iPhone activation lock from your iPad without the owner is to introduce proof of purchase to the Apple support group. When you give this to Apple, they can confirm the first owner of the phone and afterward can assist you with the **iPad 2 iCloud bypass**. After confirmation of purchase, they might request different documents, like one of your ID cards.

If you purchased the phone from your family member or somebody who has died, then your other choice to remove the lock is to show their death certificate to Apple. Apple will then, at that point, check the files and could unlock the iPad for you.

In the two cases, it depends on Apple to conclude whether they are happy with your files and if they might want to **bypass iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 15 Plus** lock.

## Part 3: FAQs

### What is an activation lock?

It is a component intended to prevent any other individual from utilizing your Apple iPhone 15 Plus, iPad, or iPod contact, once it's consistently lost or taken. Activation Lock turns on naturally when you turn on the Find My feature on your device.

### Can I remove the activation lock by hard reset?

A hard reset doesn't remove the activation lock from the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device. For instance, if a phone is hard reset with the Google account signed in, the phone will, in any case, request you to enter the account credentials once turned back on.

### How to remove the activation lock when I have my Apple ID and password?

You can unlock your device the same way as the previous owner would do remotely, as stated above. So, when you have the iCloud account credentials, you can follow our steps, and your iPad will unlock.

## Conclusion

Many reasons can compel you to bypass iPad activation Lock without a past user. This article discusses how to remove the iPad activation lock with the assistance of iCloud or settings from iDevices. However, if you don't have the Mac ID credentials of your iPad, you will require help from a third-party tool that can bypass iPad activation lock.
