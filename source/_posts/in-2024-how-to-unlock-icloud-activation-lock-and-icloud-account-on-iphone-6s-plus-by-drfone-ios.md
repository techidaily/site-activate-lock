### What is the iCloud activation lock?

An activation lock has been developed to stop others from using your Apple iPhone 6s Plus, iPad, iPod, or Apple Watch if it is stolen or lost. Your Apple iPhone 6s Plus should be iPhone 4S, 5, 5C, 5S, SE, 6, 6S, or 6S + to have the services of the iCloud activation lock.

### How do I know My Apple iPhone 6s Plus was iCloud activation locked?

If you are purchasing an iPhone or any other Apple device from someone, you need to make sure that the Apple device is no longer linked to the prior owner's account. To make sure you are on the safe side, you could check it for yourself. There are two ways to check:

1\. You can visit [https://icloud.com/activationlock](https://icloud.com/activationlock) from any Computer or MAC to check the present Activation Lock status of the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device.

2\. Follow the steps below to be sure that you can use your Apple iPhone 6s Plus device hassle-free:

1) Switch on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device and slide to unlock it.

If the screen displays a passcode lock screen or you can see the Home Screen, the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device you have purchased has not been erased. The seller will go to Settings > General > Reset > Erase All Content and Settings. Ensure the seller clears the phone before he hands it over to you for use.
