## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 13 or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

If it’s a new device, and you are the original owner, you will have this information ready to use for activation. Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 13 or iPad Mini.
