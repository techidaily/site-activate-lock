## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model.

In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.
