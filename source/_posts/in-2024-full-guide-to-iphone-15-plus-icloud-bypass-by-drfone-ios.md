Before buying a used iPhone or iPad, **checking the iCloud Activation Lock status** is important. Here’s how:

- **Step 1:** Power on the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device and unlock it. This step will confirm whether the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device has been properly erased.

![iphone lockscreen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/check-icloud-activation-lock-status-02.jpg)

- **Step 2:** Start setting up the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device as if it were new. This step is crucial in identifying if the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is still tied to the previous owner’s account.
- **Step 3:** During the setup, if the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device prompts you for the previous owner’s Apple ID and password, it’s a clear sign that the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device is still linked to the account.
