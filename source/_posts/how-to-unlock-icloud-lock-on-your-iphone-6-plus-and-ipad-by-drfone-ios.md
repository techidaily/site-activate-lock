The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don't have the credentials using third-party software.

Nowadays, many purchase a used iPhone instead of a fresh, out-of-the-box new one. Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 6 Plus device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.
