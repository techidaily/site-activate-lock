## Part 1: 5 Best Ways to Bypass Apple iPhone 7 Activation Lock

### 1\. Ask the previous device owner for Apple ID and passcode

For an iPhone activation lock bypass, you'll require a couple of data:

**The owner's Apple ID email and secret word.** If you want to know how to bypass Activation Lock on iPhone or iPad, it's frequently just about as straightforward as signing into the Apple iPhone 7 device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the past owner.

**The owner's four or six-digit passcodes.** You might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock if a device isn't deleted.

![owner id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-xs-xr-x-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

The following steps show the way to **bypass Apple iPhone 7** activation lock:

- Turn on your phone and follow the on-screen prompts to set up the Apple iPhone 7 device (language, WiFi, and so forth.)
- When you see the "Sign In with Apple ID" screen, enter the Appl ID credentials of the previous owner.
- With the correct credentials given, the process can proceed.
- On the other hand, if you see the passcode screen, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 7 device without Apple ID.

With the Apple iPhone 7 device fully set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the iCloud account. You can now make one more ID and sign into it.

### 2\. Remotely bypass activation lock by the previous owner

The **Apple iPhone 7 iCloud bypass** is likewise possible through iCloud. This method is helpful when the phone owner isn't with you and can't sign into their Apple ID. You'll require their Apple ID details, and they might have to verify the login activity through a different device.

Yet iCloud is a great choice for remotely bypassing a device from a client's Apple ID. The steps below will guide the owner on how they can remotely **bypass Apple iPhone 7** through iCloud:

- Visit the official iCloud website, i.e., iCloud.com, through a web browser.
- Sign in with the Mac ID details (Note: If you are performing these steps, the owner might have to verify your login is real through an iPhone or iPad related to their ID).
- Select the "Find iPhone" symbol (Note: This is the "Find My" feature; Apple hasn't changed the name on iCloud.com. However, it works for all Apple devices).

- Select the "Erase iPhone" option.

## How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 7 and iPad

There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.

With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.

## Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple

In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.

#### **Step 1:** Enter your Login Details

To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.

#### **Step 2:** Find My iPhone

Once you have gained access to your device, locate the "Find My iPhone" option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It's also the main reason why you can't access your iCloud account.

#### **Step 3:** Restore your Device

With the "Find My iPhone" option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings> General> Reset> Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.

#### **Step 4:** Sign In

With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.

## Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner

Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 7 device happens to be the real owner, then he/she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.

This approach, however, has a downside. It's only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.

## Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock

One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the [Official iPhoneUnlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare). With the help of the iCloud Activation Lock Removal process, you can easily bypass the iCloud Activation Lock and remove it completely from your device. The following is a detailed process on how you can seamlessly do it with the peace of mind that your data and all valuable information will be kept in place.

#### **Step 1:** Purchase the Service

The price at which you’ll be charged will depend on the model of your device. To buy these services, visit [the webiste](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) of Official iPhoneUnlock and select "iCloud Unlock" to its "iCloud Unlock/Activation Lock Removal" feature, then enter your IMEI number from the drop-down list as illustrated below.

![fix icloud lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14719794951413.jpg)

Choose your best-preferred method by clicking on the "Pay with Credit or Debit Card" tab and enter your bank details. Once you submit your payment, your iCloud lock will be unlocked after a period of between 2-3 days. A confirmation email will be sent to your designated email address.
