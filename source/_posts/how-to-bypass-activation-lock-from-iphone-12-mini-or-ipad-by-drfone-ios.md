## Part 1. What is Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 12 mini or iPad?

This theft deterrent feature is cool for the sole reason that it helps keep your data safe, in case of misplacement or thievery.

It is necessary when a user needs to erase data on an iOS device, set it up using a new Apple ID, or turn off Find My Apple iPhone 12 mini.

## Part 2. How to Bypass Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 12 mini or iPad with Previous Owner's Account?

Whatever the case, follow the steps below to remove the activation lock to Apple iPhone 12 mini or iPad Mini.

- **Step 5.** Chances are, the Apple iPhone 12 mini or iPad will prompt you to enter the original user’s ID and Password. Simply enter the details available to you.
- **Step 6.** Finally, the best part of the unlocking process; navigate to the settings tab to erase all data. Open up settings, click reset and proceed to erase all content, including settings.
