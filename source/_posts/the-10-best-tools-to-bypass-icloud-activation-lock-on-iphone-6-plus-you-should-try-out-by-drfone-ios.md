Asking the owner about their Apple ID credentials is the first approach in this guide. You can disable the activation lock on your Apple iPhone 6 Plus when you get those. However, this technique isn't ensured to help you, as all of you realize that iCloud has individual data about the client.

This method is best if the owner lives nearby, and you can meet face to face. In particular, they must know their Apple ID password.
