Some of the methods that have been listed above require little skills and time to bypass the activation lock. Also, the amount of cash required is minimal as compared to other methods, which can be quite expensive and complicated for some users. [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) is a better solution that will take you a long way in terms of iPhone and iCloud use compared to others, and hence you should never be worried just because you can't access your iCloud account.
