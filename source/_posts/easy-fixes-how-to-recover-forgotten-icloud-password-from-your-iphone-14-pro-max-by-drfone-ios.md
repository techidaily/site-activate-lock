If you discover that the iCloud Activation Lock is still active on your iOS device, removing it is crucial, especially if you plan to sell or repurpose it. There are a few methods to do this, depending on whether you have physical access to the phone.

### Method 1: Removing Apple ID Through Apple’s Means

The simplest way to remove the iCloud activation lock is by [<u>removing the Apple ID from the phone</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html). You can do these in two ways, as will be outlined below:

#### Method 1.1 Removing Apple ID When You Have the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device With You

When you have the iDevice with you, it’s easy to remove the Apple ID. Just follow the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Launch the **Settings** app on your device.
- **Step 2:** Tap on your profile at the top of the app.
- **Step 3:** Tap on **iCloud.**
- **Step 4:** Find the **Sign Out** button. You’ll be prompted to enter your Apple ID password. After which, turn off your **Find My** by following the on-screen instructions.

#### Method 1.2. Removing Apple ID When You Don’t Have the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device

Apple also provides a remote way to remove a device from your Apple ID. Here’s how:

- **Step 1:** Go to [<u>www.iCloud.com/find</u>](https://www.icloud.com/find).
