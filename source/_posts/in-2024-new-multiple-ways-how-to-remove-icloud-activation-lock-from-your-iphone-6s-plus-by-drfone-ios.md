This situation can be a significant hurdle, rendering the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device almost unusable. As you may expect, this article will help you **remove the iCloud Activation Lock**.

![activation lock page ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device to a specific Apple ID.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.

## Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password

If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, learning **how to remove iCloud Activation Lock** is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.

If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. If the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to **Settings >** Tap on the profile on top of the app > **Sign Out**.

![icloud sign out button](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-02.jpg)

### Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)

Alternatively, you can remove the iCloud account by following the steps below. You can ask the original owner to do this or do it independently if you can access the account.

- **Step 1:** Go to <www.iCloud.com/find> on any web browser.
- **Step 2:** Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device owner’s ID) and password.

## Bypass iCloud Activation Lock with IMEI Code On Apple iPhone 6s Plus

The iCloud IMEI Unlock method requires you to have your Apple iPhone 6s Plus IMEI number before proceeding with the iCloud lock removal process. When it comes to bypassing the activation lock, the IMEI code plays a very significant role as we're going to see as we proceed.

## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

![jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/understanding-your-imei.jpg)

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![check IMEI code on iPhone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/others/get_imei_number_settings.jpg)

![look for imei on itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-1.jpg)

**Method 3:** For Finder, locate your device from the left panel. Ensure that you're on the “General” tab, then select "Phone Number" below your device name or model to locate the IMEI number.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

**Method 4:** Retrieve the original box or packaging in which your device came when you purchased it. On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.

### 3\. iCloud IMEI Check for iPhone

For you to access and use iCloud, you need to check IMEI iCloud to retrieve or confirm your unique IMEI code. For you to unlock your iCloud account or lock it swiftly, I would highly advise you to have this 15-digit code with you on a piece of paper. Each and every iPhone device comes with an iCloud account that is distinguished by this unique number. If your iCloud account is locked, the first thing you need to do is to go through the iCloud IMEI check process to retrieve your code. You can do this by using the methods mentioned in part 1.2.

## Part 2: How to Bypass iCloud Activation with IMEI Free?

2: On your next step, you will be required to enter your payment and contact details.

3: With the payments done, you will receive a confirmation email informing you that the payment has been accepted.

Tip: The email will also contain the expected waiting period until the lock has been bypassed. In normal circumstances, expect to get an email confirming the lock bypass in a week's time.

## Part 3: How To Bypass iCloud Lock on Apple iPhone 6s Plus via the DNS Change Method

Apart from using a paid service to bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 6s Plus, you can employ a simple free-to-use unlocking method. One such method is the DNS change process. With this approach, you don’t need to use any paid service, and neither do you have to wait for days for the lock to be bypassed.

Here’s how you can unlock and bypass the iCloud Activation Lock by using the DNS change method.

1: On your iCloud Activation interface, press the “Home” button and select the “WiFi” settings option.

2: On your WiFi settings, tap on the circled “I” icon. This action will open the DNS settings.

To those located in the USA/North America, enter 104.154.51.7. To those located in Europe, enter 104.155.28.90. To those in Asia and the rest of the world, enter 104.155.220.58 and 78.109.17.60 respectively.

4: Once you have entered the DNS digits, tap “Back” and finally tap on the “Done” option.

5: To temporarily bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 6s Plus, tap on the “Activation Help” option. You will get a display message that reads “You have successfully connected to my server”.

6: Now tap on the “Menu” option. You will now be in a position to access features such as videos, games, iCloud Locked User Chats, and the internet.

The iCloud Activation Lock is no doubt a makeshift game-changer in the iOS platform. However, as robust and secure as it remains to be, it is no secret that this security feature can be bypassed if the right methods on how to bypass iCloud lock are employed. As seen in this article, regardless of whether you want to bypass iCloud lock on Apple iPhone 6s Plus by using the DNS change option, the Official iPhoneUnlock, or the iPhoneIMEI.net method, the fact remains that it is up to you to choose the preferred method to bypass iCloud lock when the need arises.
