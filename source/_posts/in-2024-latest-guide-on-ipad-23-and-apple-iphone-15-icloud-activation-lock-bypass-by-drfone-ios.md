## Latest Guide on iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 15 iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

Nowadays, many purchase a used iPhone instead of a fresh, out-of-the-box new one. Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 15 device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 15 device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.

It becomes difficult to remove a connected iCloud account without the owner entering the credentials. However, we've discovered a few potential ways to **bypass iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 15**. Also, we will introduce you to the best and expert bypass tool available in the market. Therefore, we strongly suggest you stay with us and download Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock. It is safe during the process. So, how about we begin?

Explore four practical methods to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock on your iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 15. These solutions help you regain access to your device and its features, enabling you to enjoy your iPad without any restrictions.

### Method 1. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner

The first procedure in this article is to get some information about the iCloud ID. To **bypass iPad 3** activation lock, ensure you get the correct Mac ID credentials. If you are not the Apple iPhone 15 device user, you must request the past user to give you the credentials.

However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 15 device.

**Step 2.** On your iPad, go to the "Settings" application and sign out the Mac ID. Please search for your name on the top and tap on it.

- If you have iOS 10.2 or older, go to "iCloud" and sign out.
- If you have iOS 10.3 or later variants, press your name from the settings app and click "Sign Out."

You don't need to worry about the iPad activation lock if it's a genuine phone. The past user can remotely wipe out the iPad Apple account without having the phone in their control by following these steps:

That may not be a simple process, but if you have the expected documents (for individuals who got verification of the purchase from the seller), Apple will be willing to help you.

When you give this to Apple, they can confirm the first owner of the phone and afterward can assist you with the **iPad 2 iCloud bypass**.

![activation lock page ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 15 device to a specific Apple ID.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods.

## Part 4. Method 3: Use Dedicated Third-Party Services To Remove iCloud Lock

Numerous dedicated third-party services, such as IMEICheck.co and iUnlocker.com, offer **activation lock removal** for those seeking alternative solutions. These websites typically work by using the Apple iPhone 15 device’s IMEI number to unlock the associated iCloud account.

Users visit these websites, enter their device’s IMEI number, and request the iCloud unlock service. Depending on the service provider, these platforms process the unlock request, which can take a few days. While convenient, users should exercise caution and ensure they’re using reputable services to avoid potential scams.

## Conclusion

In summary, **removing iCloud Activation Lock** can be crucial for those dealing with locked Apple devices. This article has explored several methods: using the Apple ID password, leveraging the capabilities of Dr.Fone for those without the password, and opting for third-party services.

It’s important to remember that these methods should only be used for legitimate purposes, such as unlocking a device you legally own. Dr.Fone remains a recommended tool for a comprehensive mobile solution, particularly for unlocking needs.
