## How to fix iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 14 and iPad

There’s no sad thing like working your entire life just to get yourself the latest brand of your favorite iPhone or iPad device only for you to realize that the all-too-important iCloud option has been locked out of reach either by the owner or by the company that sold it to you. Without the iCloud option, you can’t back up your information, and neither can you secure your privacy. It’s for this reason that I have with me the how-to-fix iCloud lock method. A lot of people have always argued that the iCloud lock cannot be surpassed due to certain factors. However, thanks to technology, I’m here to prove all the doubting Toms otherwise.

With the how-to-fix iCloud lock method at hand, you no longer have to worry or get stressed when purchasing an iPhone or an iPad for your own pleasure or comfort. In this article, I’m going to lay down three of the most basic and simple steps on how to fix iCloud lock in a matter of minutes.

## Method 1: Fix iCloud lock via Apple

In the recent past, Apple has tried to bar its users from unlocking iCloud storage perhaps due to the increased cases of theft and privacy breach. It, however, seems too late for the company to stop this iCloud lock fix process as they nowadays help their users in unlocking the iCloud lock. The following is one of the most commonly used iCloud lock fix methods offered by Apple as a company.

#### **Step 1:** Enter your Login Details

To gain access to your device, you first need to enter your unique Apple ID and your password and log into your device.

#### **Step 2:** Find My iPhone

Once you have gained access to your device, locate the "Find My iPhone" option and turn it off. This particular option functions by locking your iCloud as a security measure. It's also the main reason why you can't access your iCloud account.

#### **Step 3:** Restore your Device

With the "Find My iPhone" option turned off, reset your device by deleting all your data and settings. You can do this by following this procedure. Click on Settings> General> Reset> Erase Content and all Settings. This process will completely erase your device to its default state. You should also note that this procedure may vary from one version to another.

#### **Step 4:** Sign In

With your phone back to its default state, sign in using your Apple details as explained in step 1. Once you are logged in, just set up your iPad or iPhone with new details. Also, try to access the iCloud option to make sure that the lock is no longer available. Once you are satisfied with what you see, simply sign out and sign in back again just to be sure. If everything is okay, then you are good to go.

## Method 2: How to fix iCloud lock through the owner

Another easy iCloud lock fix method is by directly contacting the owner. In most circumstances, many iPhone and iPad users usually lock up the iCloud option as a way of protecting their privacy. If the person who sold you the Apple iPhone 14 device happens to be the real owner, then he/she should be in a position to give you the iCloud unlock codes.

This approach, however, has a downside. It's only applicable if you can track down the rightful owner of the iPad or iPhone device or if the company that sold it to you know how to remove the lock. If you can’t get through to the owner, then I would recommend you to look for other alternatives as we’re going to see in this article.

## Method 3: How to fix iCloud lock via Official iPhoneUnlock

One of the greatest, safest and swift methods of fixing the iCloud lock is by using the [Official iPhoneUnlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare).

Choose your best-preferred method by clicking on the "Pay with Credit or Debit Card" tab and enter your bank details. Once you submit your payment, your iCloud lock will be unlocked after a period of between 2-3 days. A confirmation email will be sent to your designated email address.

Not to be confused with Apple's two-step authentication, the new and more secure two-factor authentication on iCloud introduces push notifications on your iOS device to keep your data safe. With Apple's two unique ways to prove your identity, hackers will find it harder to access your personal and financial data.

Switching to two-factor authentication rather than two-step is becoming more common nowadays as security measures are more advanced. You can always switch your security measure at any point, but remember that two-factor authentication is now an essential way to keep your data safe.

Setting up two-factor authentication is a secure way to protect your device against unauthorized access. Adding another layer to your username and password highly reduces the chances of hackers obtaining your account.

Here are some of the benefits of activating two-factor authentication on your device.

- **Improved security** - A second form of identification aside from your password reduces the chance for someone to gain access to your information.
- **Interconnectivity to mobile engagement** - Two-factor authentication from businesses provides users with a stronger login system to ensure their information is safe in the digital world.
- **Reduces Fraud** - Due to the rise of identity theft in recent years, businesses risk losing trust, brand equity, and credibility. A secure authentication system adds a layer of protection to keep you secure.

## Part 3: How To Set up Two-factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you haven't set up two-factor authentication yet on your iCloud, here are the steps to activate it right now.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone 14/iPad, go to **Settings** and tap your Apple ID profile at the top.

![setup icloud 2 factor authentication iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/setup-icloud-two-factor-authentication.jpg)

**Step 2**: Tap **Password & Security** and turn On **Two-Factor Authentication**.

**Step 3**: Enter a phone number to receive the two-factor code via an SMS or a phone call.

**Step 4**: Enter the 6-digit verification code received on your device and wait for the process the finish.

**Note**

You can turn off two-factor authentication within two weeks of enrollment. After that, it's permanent.

## Part 4: How To Turn Off Two-Factor Authentication on Your Apple iPhone 14?

As previously stated, once two-factor authentication is active on iCloud, you only have a two-week window to deactivate it again.

To get past two-factor authentication on iCloud, Go to **Settings** > **your name** > **Password & Security**. Tap **Two-Factor Authentication** and turn it **Off** again.

Meanwhile, here are the steps to learn how to bypass 2-step verification on iCloud on the web.

**Step 1**: Go to the [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin) sign-in page and log in with your Apple ID.

**Step 2**: Click **Sign-In and Security > Account Security**.

![setup icloud 2 factor authentication iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/turn-off-two-factor-authentication-icloud.jpg)

**Step 3**: Click **Turn Off Two-Step Verification.** Answer a security question you've set up previously to finish the process.

## Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you're wondering how to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud, the answer is no, you can't. However, if you don't have access to your trusted device, you can have a code sent to your trusted phone number via an SMS or an automated phone call to prove to Apple that you own the iCloud account.

If this is impossible, you should request [account recovery](https://iforgot.apple.com/) to regain access to your account.

The easiest way to prevent this issue is by adding another phone number to your Apple ID so you'll always have a backup. Here's how.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone 14, go to **Settings** and tap on your **Apple ID** > **Password & Security**.

**Step 2**: Tap **Edit** and choose to **Add a Trusted Phone Number**. You'll have to enter your device's passcode to continue.

![add trusted phone number apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/add-trusted-phone-number-icloud.jpg)

**Step 3**: Enter your new phone number. Select a way to receive a verification code via sms or phone call and tap **Send**.

**Step 4**: Enter the verification code and wait for the process to finish.

## Bonus Tips: Forgot Your iCloud Password? Here's What To Do

Using special programs like [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) can help you recover your iOS device if you forget your iCloud password.

Dr.Fone's key features are:

- Removes all types of iPhone locks such as Apple ID password, Face ID, Touch ID, and more.
- Bypass iCloud activation lock.
- Unlock your Apple iPhone 14 without carrier restrictions.
- Remove MDM profile / bypass MDM lock without data loss.


Here's how to use Dr.Fone if you forget your iCloud password.

**Step 1**: Download and install [Dr.Fone](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/).

![unlock icloud using drfone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

**Step 2**: Click **Screen Unlock** on the main program window. On the next screen, click **Bypass Activate Lock**.

**Note**

Your iPhone will need to be jailbroken before bypassing it using Dr.Fone.

After step 3, there are two possible outcomes for GSM and CDMA iPhone devices.

- If you own a GSM device, the unlocking will do no harm to your iOS device, and you can enjoy your Apple iPhone 14 as usual.
- If the Apple iPhone 14 is CDMA, you won't be able to use the Apple iPhone 14 device for phone calls, cellular data, and iCloud of your new Apple ID.


### Conclusion

Turning on your iCloud's two-factor authentication is necessary for today's high-tech society. It ensures your information is always secure and minimizes the risk of getting hacked or having your account stolen. Once two-factor is active on your Apple ID, Apple provides you with a two-week window to deactivate it if you change your mind.

Meanwhile, if you forgot your iCloud and have a hard time recovering your account, you can try using dedicated programs like Dr.Fone to unlock your iOS device in a few steps.
