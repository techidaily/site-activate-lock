## How To Bypass iCloud By Checkra1n Even On Apple iPhone 14 Plus If You've Tried Everything

Since iOS 12.3, Apple has been using its new Activation Lock feature to deter theft. This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.

While this is a welcomed addition for those looking to protect their device, it can also be a major inconvenience for those who have lost or forgotten their iCloud password. Checkra1n is a new tool that allows users to bypass iCloud activation without entering any login information. You will learn in this post how to use Checkra1n iCloud bypass to unlock your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad.

Let's get started!

## Part 1: What is Checkra1n?

Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.

Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don't know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.

Additionally, checkra1n does not require you to sign the jailbreak IPA file (using AltStore or the Developer Account at Apple), which makes it much easier to use. Overall, checkra1n is a powerful tool that you can use to access data on locked iPhones, even if you don't know the passcode.

**Pros**

- The tool doesn't require tech skills
- It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices
- Supports a wide range of hardware platforms
- It is not possible to exploit remotely

**Cons**

- Jailbreaking older devices is limited
- A reboot won't save them

## Latest Guide on iPad 2/3 and Apple iPhone 14 Plus iCloud Activation Lock Bypass

Nowadays, many purchase a used iPhone instead of a fresh, out-of-the-box new one. Nonetheless, they often face the activation lock screen issue on the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device once they buy them. This case will probably happen because the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device stays connected with the past owner's iCloud account.

However, this strategy may not help you as you know that iCloud has all the individual data about the client. Therefore, no one will want to give them to another person. So, you will be left without a response. So, we could never recommend you focus on this strategy. However, provided with the details, you can disable the Find My feature and remove the activation lock. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Enter the Apple ID and password on the activation lock screen to get to the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device.

Jailbreak on Mac and Windows should be the first thing you need to do when you are going to **bypass the Activation Lock**. As we know, many available tools in the market are not compatible with it. You should know what needs to be prepared before you jailbreak on Windows and Mac.

##### Jailbreak on Windows

The first thing you need to make sure of is that your computer runs on version 7 or above, and you have a USB flash drive with 2 GB capacity. After that, download the "[checkn1x-amd64.iso](https://drfone.wondershare.com/unlock/checkn1x-amd64.iso)" and "[WinRa1n2.0](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=10620683726822078150)."

##### Jailbreak on Mac

To jailbreak iOS on Mac, download the "[Checkra1n](https://checkra.in/releases/0.12.4-beta#all-downloads)" and then simply try to connect the Mac computer and the iOS device using a USB cable.

#### Step-by-Step Guide to Bypass Activation Lock

There are some steps that you need to follow in order to **bypass the Activation Lock** using Wondershare Dr.Fone. These steps are:

**Step 1: Install and Download Dr.Fone, and Select Remove Active Lock**

On your computer system, install and download Wondershare Dr.Fone and hit the “Screen Unlock” module from the main interface. Now go to the “Unlock Apple ID” option and then choose “Remove Active Lock".

**Step 2: Jailbreak and Confirm Device Information**

Now jailbreak your Apple iPhone 14 Plus, and once it is done, a warning message will appear on the screen. You need to “Tick” the confirmation statement that you agree with the terms and conditions and click on the “Next” button. You are also required to confirm the information, like the Apple iPhone 14 Plus device model.
