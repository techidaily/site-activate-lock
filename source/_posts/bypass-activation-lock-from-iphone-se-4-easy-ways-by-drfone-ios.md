## Part 3: FAQs

### 1\. When Do We Require iCloud DNS Bypass?

We require it when our carrier locks our phone or when we buy a used phone and cannot use it because of an iCloud activation lock. The use of iCloud DNS bypass enables temporary access to the features and functionality of an iCloud-locked device. Domain Name Server, or DNS for short, serves the function of converting your domain names into IP addresses.

### 2\. What Can iCloud DNS Bypass Do for Us?

When you need an urgent functioning solution for a locked iPhone, using iCloud DNS bypass is helpful since it gives you temporary access to all the features and configuration of an iCloud-restricted device. DNS, or domain name server, converts your domain names into IP addresses.

### 3\. What are the Pros & Cons of iCloud DNS Bypass

This approach can be helpful, but it does have advantages and pitfalls of its own. These advantages and disadvantages are broken down as follows:

**Pros**

- You may use it without installing any software on the Apple iPhone SE device, since you can do it in the Wi-Fi settings.
- The internet, camera, and games can all be used after the gadget has been engaged, making it simple to access.
- Utilizing this approach is cost-free.

**Cons**

- This technique only partially unlocks the Apple iPhone SE device and represents a hack.
- The iCloud DNS bypassing technique has occasionally been reported as not working by users.
