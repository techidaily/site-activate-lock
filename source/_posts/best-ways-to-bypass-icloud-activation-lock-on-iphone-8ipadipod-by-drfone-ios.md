**Step 2.** Click on the "i" and enter the DNS server IP according to your area, which is:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- The rest: 78.100.17.60

**Step 3.** Go back and turn on Wi-Fi.

**Step 4.** Tap on Next Page and go back to bypass the lock.

**Step 5.** Set up the gadget according to your liking.

The downside of this strategy is that it is short-term. When you reboot your iOS gadget, the activation lock comes back up, and you'll need to do it again. That can get irritating and wasteful.
