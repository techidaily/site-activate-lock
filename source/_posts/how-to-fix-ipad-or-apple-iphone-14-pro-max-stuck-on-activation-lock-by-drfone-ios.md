#### 2\. Online Activation Lock Bypassing Service

Several online services are available that claim to remove activation lock from iPhone. Some of these services are available at absolutely no cost. One cannot expect a high success rate in comparison to the premium paid services. Besides, one may not even receive any warranty for any data or hardware loss or damage due to the service.

There is no need to download any additional tools and programs or hardware for this purpose. Getting started with an activation lock online bypassing service is straightforward.

**Step 1:** Begin by entering the details of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max model.

Upon confirming the information details, click on "Confirm Order". If the service is free, no order payment page will show up. Instead, a pop-up window may show. This solution is pretty permanent and allows users to set new credentials like a new device.

#### 3\. A Loophole: DNS Bypass

Most iPhones today run on the latest iOS versions. However, if the user has an iPhone running on an older version of the operating system, the DNS method can be used to bypass the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device activation lock. This technique uses a loophole in the Wi-Fi DNS settings on the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max device. It tricks the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max into thinking that it is unlocked.

Listed below are the steps to be followed to remove the "Find My iPhone" activation lock in the absence of the previous iPhone user.

**Step 1:** Start by setting up the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max as a new device. The user must wait until they reach the Wi-Fi settings page.

**Step 2:** On opening the Wi-Fi screen, connect to a strong Wi-Fi network. Next to the chosen network name, tap on the "I" icon available on the right-hand side.

![bypass apple activation lock 9](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/dns-1.jpg)

**Step 3:** From the following screen, tap on the shown "Configure DNS" option.

![bypass apple activation lock 10](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/dns-2.jpg)

**Step 4:** The next step is to choose the manual option available at the top of the page and use one of the DNS values mentioned below.

![bypass apple activation lock 11](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2021/12/dns-3.jpg)

- Asia – 104.155.220.58
- Europe – 104.155.28.90
- Australia and Oceania – 35.189.47.23
- North America – 104.154.51.7
- South America – 35.199.88.219

This must get the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max unlocked by now.

#### 4\. The Official Approach - Apple Support
