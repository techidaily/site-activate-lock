Yet, circumventing security features may violate terms of service. It's important to know that attempting to bypass the Activation Lock might void warranties.

2. **How Does Activation Lock Work on Mac?**

**Activation Lock on Mac** is part of Apple's security framework designed to deter unauthorized access and protect user data. When enabled, Activation Lock ties the Mac to the owner's Apple ID. It requires the correct credentials to disable Find My Mac, erase the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device, or reactivate it after a factory reset. This feature effectively prevents unauthorized users from accessing or using a locked Mac.

3. **What Are the Risks of Bypassing Activation Lock?**

Bypassing Activation Lock might carry the following risks and implications:

1. It can expose the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device and personal data to potential security threats.
2. Unauthorized modifications or bypassing of security measures could void the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device's warranty.
3. Improper bypass attempts might lead to device malfunction.
