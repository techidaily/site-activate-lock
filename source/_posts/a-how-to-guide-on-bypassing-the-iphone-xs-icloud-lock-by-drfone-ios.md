## Part 1: 4 Efficient Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone XS iCloud Activation Lock

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner

![owners apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone XS iCloud bypass**:
