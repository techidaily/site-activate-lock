<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zQckthGQm-8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

## Part 1: How do I know My Apple iPhone SE (2020) has an iCloud account lock on it?

If your Apple iPhone SE (2020) has an iCloud account lock on, it simply means that you cannot use it unless you unlock it.

At the beginning of 2015, Apple added a new security feature to iOS that changed how iCloud accounts are managed via Apple devices such as iPhone, iPad, iPod, and iWatch. The security feature was known as [iCloud Activation Lock](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/remove-icloud-activation-lock.html). What this meant is that your Apple device is now locked to your iCloud account. In other words, you have to enter your user ID and password whenever you want to access your device's files, features, and functions.

This is not supposed to be a big issue if you bought a brand new iPhone, iPad, or iWatch. However, things start getting thick whenever you buy [a second-hand iPhone](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/unlock-icloud-activation.html) from eBay, a colleague, a friend, and so on. Of course, you could ask your friend (if you bought the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device from them) to give you the username and password. Unfortunately, some may not be cooperative, while others might not be reachable.

It doesn't matter what you do with your Apple iPhone SE (2020). Whether you [jailbreak](https://drfone.wondershare.com/ios-14/ios-14-jailbreak.html) it, [reset](https://drfone.wondershare.com/reset-iphone/factory-reset-iphone-without-passcode.html) it or pay someone to hack it, you will still not gain access to your device and use it. This could be a very frustrating experience, especially if you just parted with something like $550 to acquire your Apple iPhone SE (2020).

If you cannot use your Apple iPhone SE (2020) or iPad because iCloud is locked, then it means your Phone is iCloud-locked. The only way to deal with this problem is to unlock the iCloud account and set up a new iCloud account.

## Part 3: How to bypass iCloud activation on iOS 11 devices?

Starting with iOS 11, Apple has introduced a bizarre bug in their Activation mechanism that allows you to bypass iCloud activation completely (with SIM card working) in certain conditions. The bug relies on the passcode activation method and requires Second Factor Authentication (2FA) to be enabled on the account to which the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device is locked. As of iOS 11, the passcode activation option appears for the iCloud Locked devices if 2FA is on.

The bug allows a user to input a false passcode “0000” or “0000” if the requirement is for a 6-digit passcode a few times, then leave the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device to rest for ~1 hour, so that the session with the Apple Activation Server (albert.apple.com) expires. After that, the user would input the false passcode a few more times and the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device will skip the activation part, essentially disabling Find My iPhone server-side.

A video tutorial on how to apply this method can be followed here:

<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdhzPLQhWa0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

Note: You can only follow this tutorial on iOS 13/.x. iOS 10 and iOS 9 versions do not have the “Activate with passcode” option. Apple has patched this bug on the newer firmware, so it is recommended to try on iOS 11.1.1 and lower.

If 2FA is not enabled in the account, you will not see the “Activate with Passcode” option under the Username and Password fields. Instead, you will see an option called “Activation Help”.

## Part 4: How to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone?

### Steps to erase data remotely from your lost iPhone

Third-party tools like [<u>Wondershare Dr.Fone</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/) provide an effective solution when you can’t access the Apple ID passcode. Dr.Fone is recognized as an all-in-one mobile solution, catering to various needs beyond unlocking devices. It has features like recovery, [<u>system repair</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/iphone-problems/iphone-13-black-screen.html), [<u>data transfer</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/android-transfer/android-to-android-data-transfer-app.html), [<u>backup and restore</u>](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/restore-from-icloud-backup.html), and Screen Unlock (iOS).

The Screen Unlock feature is valuable for bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock without needing the original Apple ID passcode. It’s a useful tool for those who have bought a second-hand device still tied to the previous owner’s Apple ID or have forgotten their Apple ID details.

Read the steps below to learn how to use the Screen Unlock feature to remove the iCloud Activation Lock.

### Method 2.1: Removing Apple ID Without Jailbreak

This can be any time before the phone is reset. The steps below guide you how to remove the Apple ID from the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device.

- **Step 1:** Download and install Wondershare Dr.Fone from the [<u>official website</u>](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/drfone-toolkit/).


- **Step 2:** Open **Toolbox > Screen Unlock > iOS**.

### Method 2.2: Bypassing iCloud Activation Lock (Jailbreak Method)

If your device is on the activation screen, the above-presented method will not work. This is where you’ll have to jailbreak your device and **bypass the iCloud Activation Lock** with Dr.Fone. It might seem daunting. Don’t worry, as Dr.Fone will be guiding you through this. Just follow the steps below:

- **Step 1:** Go to **Toolbox > Screen Unlock > iOS**.

![dr.fone home](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/drfone-home.png)

- **Step 3:** This time, choose **iCloud Activation Lock Removal**.

![dr.fone screen unlock page](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-1.png)

- **Step 5:** When Dr.Fone prompts you to connect your Apple iPhone SE (2020), use a cable to connect it to your computer.

![dr.fone connect phone prompt](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/screen-unlock-2.png)

- **Step 6:** To identify if your phone is GSM or CDMA, navigate to **Settings > General > About**. If it’s CDMA, cellular/SIM functions won’t work, but other features remain usable. Upon selecting **Unlock Now**, a warning pop-up appears. Confirm by clicking **Got it**.

![dr.fone bypass cdma warning](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-6.png)

- **Step 7:** At this part, you should jailbreak your device. Click **JailBreak Guide** or **Watch Video** to be guided on the process.

![jailbreak confirmation](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/guide/bypass-activation-lock-7.png)

## Part 4. Method 3: Use Dedicated Third-Party Services To Remove iCloud Lock

Numerous dedicated third-party services, such as IMEICheck.co and iUnlocker.com, offer **activation lock removal** for those seeking alternative solutions. These websites typically work by using the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device’s IMEI number to unlock the associated iCloud account.

Users visit these websites, enter their device’s IMEI number, and request the iCloud unlock service. Depending on the service provider, these platforms process the unlock request, which can take a few days. While convenient, users should exercise caution and ensure they’re using reputable services to avoid potential scams.

## Conclusion

In summary, **removing iCloud Activation Lock** can be crucial for those dealing with locked Apple devices. This article has explored several methods: using the Apple ID password, leveraging the capabilities of Dr.Fone for those without the password, and opting for third-party services.

It’s important to remember that these methods should only be used for legitimate purposes, such as unlocking a device you legally own. Dr.Fone remains a recommended tool for a comprehensive mobile solution, particularly for unlocking needs.
