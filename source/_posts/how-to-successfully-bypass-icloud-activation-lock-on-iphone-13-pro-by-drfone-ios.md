### Fix 5. Consider Using Other Options in Checkra1n

If the reason behind **Checkra1n error 31** is the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device incompatibility, Checkra1n provides an inbuilt way. When jailbreaking a device, Checkra1n allows you to select the "Untested versions" option. While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:

**Instructions.** To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the "Options" and select the "Untested Versions" and "Safe Mode" options. Then, try jailbreaking your device and see if error 31 is resolved.

### Fix 6. Try a Special Method While Using Checkra1n

At times, the solutions you are looking for can be found among the experiences of fellow users. We found a Reddit post in our search to find solutions to **Checkra1n Error 31**. In this post, a Reddit user explained a hack he had found to solve error 31 when jailbreaking using Checkra1n.

Remember that this hack includes a specific Checkra1n version and experience that specific user. While you can emulate the experience, the results aren't guaranteed. Here is what that user tried for successful jailbreaking using Checkra1n:

- **Step 1.** Download and install the Checkra1n version 0.10.2 beta on your computer. Now, connect your Apple iPhone 13 Pro to DFU Mode to the system. Initiate the jailbreaking process until the "Right before Trigger" option appears.
