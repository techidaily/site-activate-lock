## How to jailbreak iCloud locked Apple iPhone 6s

Jailbreaking is an act of removing different software restrictions imposed on your Apple iPhone 6s by your operating system, in this case, iOS. Once such restrictions have been removed, you can download applications that were previously restricted by the Apple operating system. If you want to jailbreak iCloud locked iPhone, I have some methods which you can use to bypass these restrictions. What you should keep in mind is the fact that you first have to remove the iCloud lock and then jailbreak your Apple iPhone 6s.

## Part 1: Will Jailbreaking Remove iCloud lock?
