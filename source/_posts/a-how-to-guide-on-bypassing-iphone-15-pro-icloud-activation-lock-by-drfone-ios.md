### Fix 5. Consider Using Other Options in Checkra1n

If the reason behind **Checkra1n error 31** is the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device incompatibility, Checkra1n provides an inbuilt way. When jailbreaking a device, Checkra1n allows you to select the "Untested versions" option. While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 15 Pro device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:

**Instructions.** To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the "Options" and select the "Untested Versions" and "Safe Mode" options. Then, try jailbreaking your device and see if error 31 is resolved.
