## Part 3: How to Free Unlock the iCloud Lock on iPhone

Since your Apple iPhone 6 Plus is locked, you will not be able to access files until you unlock iCloud on your Apple device. One way to unlock iCloud locked phone is to bypass the iCloud activation lock by following the steps below

Step 1. Take your Apple iPhone 6 Plus and while on the "Activate iPhone" screen, press the home button and then press the "Wi-Fi" settings. Next to the "Wi-Fi" symbol, tap on "i". Now you need to change the existing DNS settings. The DNS settings you need to type are as follows:

1. If you are in the USA type in 104.154.51.7
2. In Europe, type 104.155.28.90
3. In Asia, type 104.155.220.58
4. The rest of the world, please type in 78.109.17.60

Step 2. Tap on the "Back" button then click "Done". Next, click "Activation help". Once you have done that, you will see a message that says: You have successfully connected to my server." If you tap on the menu, you will be able to access different iCloud services such as iCloud Locked User Chat, Mail, Social, Maps, Video, YouTube, Audia, and games, among others.

## Part 4: How to unlock iCloud lock by Apple iPhone Unlock

Sometimes it may not be possible to completely unlock your iCloud Lock. For instance, the free method of unlocking your iCloud Lock only works on iOS 9 and iOS 8 for iPhones. Anything else will not work properly. Moreover, you may not be able to know how to unlock iCloud lock-free if you are in certain countries. That is when you can think of using the Official iPhone Unlock service which will completely unlock your Apple iPhone 6 Plus without any hassle. The iCloud Activation Lock Removal tool will quickly remove the iCloud activation lock from the previous owner's account. In short, this is an easy and seamless tool for removing the iCloud lock to set your own.

Step 1 - Visit the [Apple iPhone unlock](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) by clicking on this link.

Step 2 - Enter the IMEI/Serial number of your device and send it.

![Enter your IMEI/Serial number](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2016/08/14720745007162.jpg)

Step 3 - Just wait for a confirmation message telling you that the iCloud Lock has been removed.

Step 4 - Now create a new iCloud account and start using your device

This tool works on all iPhone 6, 6+, 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4, and iPad 4, 3, 2 Air 2 and also works on iOS, and it doesn't matter why you are unlocking it from.

### Wrap it up

Unlike the free iCloud Lock unlock solution, Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iCloud Activation Lock Removal) tool provides a permanent solution to the problem of how to unlock iCloud locked irrespective of your country. It will only cost you a couple of dollars pounds to unlock your Phone. This is a small price to pay because you might have spent hundreds of dollars to purchase a new iPhone or iPad.
