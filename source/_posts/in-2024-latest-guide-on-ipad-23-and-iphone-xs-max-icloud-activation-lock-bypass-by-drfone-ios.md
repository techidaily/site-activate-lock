For instance, when Find My iPhone is initiated, you can see where your Apple iPhone XS Max is. You might use it to show your location to others or play a sound on your lost device, making it easier to find.

To utilize this feature, you need to initiate this feature on your device and utilize a PC or another phone to find, reset or lock your lost iPhone.

Switching it off will not erase any of your data, so you don't have to stress over that. It'll simply make it difficult to track down your Apple iPhone XS Max on a map when lost.

The best way to switch off the Find My feature is very direct. The following steps will tell you how to make it happen:

- Open the Settings of your Apple iPhone XS Max and tap your name or profile.
- Explore the "Find My" option and go for "Find My iPhone."
- If the Find My iPhone feature is initiated, the toggle button on top of the page should be green. Switch the "Find My iPhone" toggle key to turn it off.
- Enter your Apple ID details.
- Affirm your activity, and that's all you need to turn this feature off.
