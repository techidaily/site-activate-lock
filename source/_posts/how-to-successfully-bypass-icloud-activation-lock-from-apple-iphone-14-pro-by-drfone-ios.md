## How to Successfully Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on Apple iPhone 14 Pro

An activation lock is a necessary feature of modern devices due to security breaches. It prevents your phone from getting used by the wrong hands. Consequently, it secures your data from getting exploited in case of theft.

However, it can be troublesome if you don't take enough care. Your phone can get stuck on the activation lock screen if you don't remember the password or have bought a second-hand device.

If your Apple iPhone 14 Pro is iCloud locked, there are ways to get it unlocked. We'll initially suggest reaching the seller. We will clear up the **Apple iPhone 14 Pro iCloud bypass** methods if you can't. So sit back and relax. This detailed guide explains how to perform **Apple iPhone 14 Pro iCloud bypass.**

## Part 1: How to Bypass Apple iPhone 14 Pro iCloud Activation Lock?

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the previous owner

Asking the owner about their Apple ID credentials is the first approach in this guide. You can disable the activation lock on your Apple iPhone 14 Pro when you get those. However, this technique isn't ensured to help you, as all of you realize that iCloud has individual data about the client.

Subsequently, no owner will want to give them to another person. In this way, you will be left without a response. It is a bad situation, so we could never propose you focus on this method for **Apple iPhone 14 Pro iCloud bypass**.

This method is best if the owner lives nearby, and you can meet face to face. In particular, they must know their Apple ID password. When you get together, request them to enter their Apple ID credentials, since they might be reluctant to share them via a call. It is very straightforward to remove their Apple ID and the activation lock.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods.
