### Method 1. Contact the Previous Device Owner for Apple ID and Password

The first step in bypassing the iCloud Activation Lock is to reach out to the previous owner of the Apple iPhone 13 Pro and ask for their Apple ID and password. To **bypass Apple iPhone 13 Pro**, you need to have some data in hand:

- Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you're the second owner.
- If a device doesn't have the activation lock, you can see the password screen rather than the iCloud lock screen. In that case, ask the old user about the Apple iPhone 13 Pro passcode.

![enter icloud details](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting this data, coming up next are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone 13 Pro iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photo on this window. If the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device has a more up-to-date version of iOS, tap the iCloud option from the menu.
- **Step 3:** Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.
- **Step 4:** Next, look down and click the Sign Out option. When asked, you need to enter the Apple account credentials of the first owner to toggle off the Find My feature.

However, if you see the Apple iPhone 13 Pro passcode, you can type it and set up the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device without the iCloud account.

With the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old ID. You can now make another one and sign into it.

### Method 2. Contact the Previous Device Owner to Remove Activation Lock Remotely

If the iPhone's first owner (seller) has forgotten to do this before selling it to you, it's time to do it. It would help if you convinced the owner to remove the sold device from their iCloud account. They can even do that remotely by just visiting the iCloud webpage.

However, if they have sold you a stolen iPhone, you may be unable to remove the lock using this technique.

So, if it's not a stolen device, you don't need to worry about unlocking it. The owner can remotely control the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device and **bypass Apple iPhone 13 Pro** by following these steps:

- **Step 1:** Go to the appleid.apple.com site and sign in with the right iCloud account credentials.
- **Step 2:** Click the Apple iPhone 13 Pro devices tab to see all the connected iDevices.
- **Step 3:** Pick your Apple iPhone 13 Pro model from there.
- **Step 4:** Then, click Erase from Account to get it unlocked. It's as simple as that.

![remove or erase](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-11-12-icloud-bypass-2.jpg)

### Method 3. Use iCloud DNS Bypass

The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device's features. DNS interprets your domains into IP addresses. After keying in a domain name, your DNS server takes you to that specific IP address on the internet. When you attempt to activate your Apple iPhone 13 Pro, your device connects with the DNS and the Mac servers. Someway, you can key in some domain name servers here, and they will take your device to that server.

**How Can iCloud DNS Bypass Help You?**

A DNS bypass can do plenty of things for you. You can unlock your device with it. When the Apple iPhone 13 Pro device unlocks, you can access applications internet and work smoothly on your costly device. It opens up most features of your Apple iPhone 13 Pro.

**Limitations of this Features**

When you use other ways to unlock the iCloud lock, it completely gets removed from your device, and you can utilize each feature. Unfortunately, that isn't true with an iCloud DNS bypass server. If you utilize this technique, you can access specific features.

The steps in DNS Bypass iCloud Activation are very straightforward; here are the steps.

- **Step 1:** When you switch on your device, pick your LANGUAGE and COUNTRY from the menu.
- **Step 2.** Click "Proceed" to enter the Wi-Fi settings page. Whenever requested to connect with Wi-Fi, search for the "I" icon near the Wi-Fi tab.

#### **Step 1:** Visit Official iPhone Unlock Website

Visit [Official iPhoneUnlock website](https://appleiphoneunlock.uk/network/Special%20Services/Activation%20Lock?aff=wondershare) and select "iCloud Unlock".

#### **Step 2:** Add Contact Details

Once you have clicked on the “Add to Cart” icon, a new page with an email option under the “Contact Details” will open up. Add your valid email address in the space provided. Be sure to insert a valid email, as it will be used to communicate with you the moment your Apple iPhone 13 Pro iCloud Lock has been bypassed.

#### **Step 3:** Pay Options

With your valid email submitted, you will be requested to enter your payment details. Simply choose between Visa, MasterCard, and American Express and click on the “Pay with Credit or Debit Card” icon. Once you have confirmed your payments details, a confirmation email will be sent to your designated email address. After three (3) business days, you’ll receive an email confirming that the iCloud lock has been bypassed successfully. From that point, you can comfortably use your device as you please.

## Conclusion

From the methods mentioned above, it’s easy to see that it only takes a matter of days to unlock the iCloud account or to completely remove the stubborn iCloud lock. The diversity of both methods allows you to easily pick and use the best method that suits your preferences. Regardless of whether you want to download iCloud remover, or you simply want to go for an easy-to-use and pocket-friendly online platform, the fact remains that both of these methods have got you covered.

The iCloud unlocker download method though effective requires a lot of time to go through it and don’t forget the amount of money used to get it working. On the other hand, what I like about our second method is the fact that it's more efficient and easy to use. With it, I don't have to go through the tiring and complex downloading process, since the company itself bypasses the lock and renders My Apple iPhone 13 Pro usable.
