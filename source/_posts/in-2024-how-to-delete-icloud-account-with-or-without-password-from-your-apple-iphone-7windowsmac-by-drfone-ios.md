A hard reset doesn't remove the activation lock from the Apple iPhone 7 device. For instance, if a phone is hard reset with the Google account signed in, the phone will, in any case, request you to enter the account credentials once turned back on.

### How to remove the activation lock when I have my Apple ID and password?

You can unlock your device the same way as the previous owner would do remotely, as stated above. So, when you have the iCloud account credentials, you can follow our steps, and your iPad will unlock.

## Conclusion

Many reasons can compel you to bypass iPad activation Lock without a past user. This article discusses how to remove the iPad activation lock with the assistance of iCloud or settings from iDevices. However, if you don't have the Mac ID credentials of your iPad, you will require help from a third-party tool that can bypass iPad activation lock.
