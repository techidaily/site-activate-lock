### Fix 3. Download New Checkra1n Version

Crucial for a successful jailbreak is carefully selecting the [<u>appropriate Checkra1n version</u>](https://checkra.in/).

### Fix 4. Install iOS Firmware From iTunes and Retry Jailbreaking

When encountering **Checkra1n jailbreak**, error 31 may be attributed to the iOS version on your device. In such cases, the optimal resolution involves reinstalling the iOS version through iTunes. Follow the steps below to personally choose the IPSW file and employ iTunes for the installation on your iOS device:

- **Step 1.** Access the ipsw.me website using a web browser and download the compatible IPSW file for your iOS device. Before installing, ensure that the "Find My" service is disabled.

![disable find my on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-15.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Connect the iOS device to the computer and wait for iTunes/Finder to detect it once all requirements are satisfied. For instance, if you have a Mac with the operating system before macOS Catalina, access the "Summary" tab by clicking the Apple iPhone 6 device icon within iTunes. While holding the "Shift" key on Windows or the "Option" key on Mac, click "Restore iPhone."

![restore iphone via itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-16.jpg)

- **Step 3.** You will be asked to select the IPSW file. Choose the file you downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. Once complete, re-try the jailbreaking and see if error 31 is resolved.

### Fix 5. Consider Using Other Options in Checkra1n

If the reason behind **Checkra1n error 31** is the Apple iPhone 6 device incompatibility, Checkra1n provides an inbuilt way. When jailbreaking a device, Checkra1n allows you to select the "Untested versions" option. While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone 6 device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:

**Instructions.** To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the "Options" and select the "Untested Versions" and "Safe Mode" options. Then, try jailbreaking your device and see if error 31 is resolved.

![enable safe mode and untested versions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-18.jpg)

### Fix 6. Try a Special Method While Using Checkra1n

Remember that this hack includes a specific Checkra1n version and experience that specific user. While you can emulate the experience, the results aren't guaranteed. Here is what that user tried for successful jailbreaking using Checkra1n:

- **Step 1.** Download and install the Checkra1n version 0.10.2 beta on your computer. Now, connect your Apple iPhone 6 to DFU Mode to the system. Initiate the jailbreaking process until the "Right before Trigger" option appears.
