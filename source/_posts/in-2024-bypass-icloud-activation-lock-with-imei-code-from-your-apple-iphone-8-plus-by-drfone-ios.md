## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone 8 Plus device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number.

## Part 1: Is It Possible to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on iPod and Apple iPhone 8 Plus By Myself?

Yes, iPod and Apple iPhone 8 Plus touch activation lock bypass can be done by yourself. However, it is not an easy process and requires some technical knowledge.

iCloud activation lock is a security feature that Apple introduced in iOS 7. It prevents anyone from using an iPhone, iPad, or iPod and Apple iPhone 8 Plus touch if it is stolen or lost. If you have an iOS device with an iCloud activation lock, you must enter the correct Apple ID and password to use it.

There are a few ways to bypass the iCloud activation lock, but they all require technical expertise. If you're not comfortable with technical things, you may want to consider taking your device to a professional. Alternatively, you can try following the instructions in one of the methods below.

## Part 2: 5 Easy Methods to Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on iPod and Apple iPhone 8 Plus

The most common question is how to bypass the iCloud activation lock on their iPhones, iPads, or iPod and Apple iPhone 8 Plus touches. While you can use several methods to achieve this, we've compiled a list of five of the most effective ones below.

### Method 1. Make the Previous Owner Remove It Remotely

If you have a personal relationship with the previous owner of the iOS device, you might be able to ask them to help you remove the Find My iPhone Activation Lock remotely using iCloud.com:

**Step 1.** Sign in to iCloud using your Apple ID and password by going to the official website.

**Step 2.** You can select the associated device by clicking All Devices at the top of the screen.

**Step 3.** You can erase the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device by clicking "Erase \[device\]".

**Step 4.** Last but not least, click "Remove from the account".

In this step, the previous owner's iCloud account has been completely removed from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device, and the Activation Lock has also been removed.

### Method 2. Get the Previous Owner's Apple ID and Password

If you have an iPod and Apple iPhone 8 Plus locked by iCloud, you'll need the previous owner's Apple ID and password to bypass the activation lock and use the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device. iCloud activation locks are put in place to protect your device and data, but if you've purchased a used iPod and Apple iPhone 8 Plus from someone who didn't remove their account information, you'll be stuck with a locked device.

### Method 3. DNS Bypass

To remove the iCloud Activation Lock iPod and Apple iPhone 8 Plus from the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device, you can use a DNS server or HTML. When you have no other choice, it's worth a shot. Please note that this method only works with newer versions of iOS, such as iOS 10.

**Step 1:** Start the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device or restart it if it is already on.

**Step 2:** Select "Choose Wi-Fi network" during the setup process.

**Step 3:** Click "More Wi-Fi Settings" and tap the "I" icon next to the Wi-Fi network.

**Step 4:** Click "Configure DNS" and choose "Manual".

**Step 5:** Select "+Add Server" and enter the server's address at your location. Use the following server addresses:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Africa, Australia, and other locations: 78.109.17.60

**Step 6:** After tapping "Save", click on the back option and select "Ask to Join Networks".

**Step 7:** Enter the network password and then tap "Join".

**Step 8:** To set up the Apple iPhone 8 Plus device normally, tap on the back button when it tries to activate.
