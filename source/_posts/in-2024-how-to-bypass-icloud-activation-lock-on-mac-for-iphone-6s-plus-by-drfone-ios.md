## How To Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on Mac For Apple iPhone 6s Plus?

_How to do Mac activation lock bypass?_

iCloud Activation Lock stands as a reliable security measure in the Apple ecosystem. It protects your Apple devices from unauthorized access and theft. Yet, navigating this security feature can be overwhelming for users locked out of their devices. It can happen due to forgotten passwords or second-hand purchases.

Mac users often seek effective methods to bypass this security measure. They aim to reclaim access to their devices without compromising safety. This article serves as a comprehensive guide, exploring the details of bypassing the iCloud **Activation Lock on Mac**. It will go through various methods, strategies, and best practices to unlock your Mac.

## Part 1. What is Mac Activation Lock?

**Mac Activation Lock**, a key part of Apple's security, safeguards your MacBook by linking it to your Apple ID. Similar to iOS devices, it makes it tough for others to access your device without permission. Once activated, it requires your Apple ID and password for various functions. These include the likes of disabling Find My Mac, erasing the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, or using it after a factory reset.

This feature works hand-in-hand with the 'Find My' app. It ensures your data's safety even if your MacBook is lost or stolen. Only the rightful owner can disable **Activation Lock Mac** via their Apple ID. Yet, dealing with this security measure might be challenging for genuine users. This is especially true if they face issues like forgotten passwords or when buying a used device.

![mac activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-mac-1.jpg)

Navigating through the iCloud **Activation Lock on a MacBook** can be daunting. This is especially true when faced with legitimate scenarios like forgotten passwords. It can also happen in the case of purchasing pre-owned locked devices. Yet, several methods and techniques exist to bypass this security feature. Below, we'll go through various methods for how to bypass iCloud **Activation Lock on Mac**:

### Fix 1. Retrieve Your Password

Forgetting the Apple ID password can often lead to being locked out of your own device due to the iCloud Activation Lock. Fortunately, Apple provides a streamlined process to reset and retrieve forgotten passwords. This allows users to regain entry to their devices. Apple offers a mechanism to reset forgotten passwords via the Apple ID account recovery process.

Visit the [Apple ID account page](https://appleid.apple.com/sign-in) through a web browser on any device. Choose the option that says, "Forgot password?" and continue by following the instructions shown on the screen. You might need to answer security questions, use two-factor authentication, or receive account recovery instructions. It can happen via email or SMS to reset the password.

### Fix 2. Remove Mac Activation Lock from Another Device

When faced with a Mac locked by iCloud Activation Lock, another effective method exists. You can bypass this security measure using another trusted device. That device must be linked to the same Apple ID as the Mac. Employing this method allows you to remove the Activation Lock from the locked Mac through the “Find My” feature. Follow these steps to bypass the **Mac Activation Lock**:

**Step 1.** Utilize a different Apple device, like an iPhone, iPad, or another Mac, that is currently signed in with the identical Apple ID. From there, navigate to the [iCloud website](https://www.icloud.com/) and sign in using your Apple account credentials.

![log in icloud account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-mac-3.jpg)

### Fix 3. Ask The Previous Owner for Help

Have you acquired a second-hand Mac that is locked with iCloud Activation Lock? If faced with this scenario, seeking assistance from the previous owner can prove to be a valuable solution. Describe your situation to the previous owner and kindly ask them to log in to their iCloud account for support. Otherwise, they can use the iCloud website to disassociate the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device from their account.

They can do this by removing the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device from their iCloud account or disabling Find My Mac. Seeking help from the previous owner to remove the **Activation Lock Mac** is often the most straightforward method.

## Part 3. FAQs About Activation Lock on Mac

### What Does iCloud Lock Mean?

Part of the normal process of setting up a new iPhone is to register the phone with an Apple ID. Each phone has a unique number, an IMEI. Also, to fully use the services offered by Apple, each user needs to have an Apple ID, which is an iTunes account. When setting up a new phone, you should enable ‘Find My iPhone.’ When you do that, the unique details are logged to the Apple account, and the phone is referred to as being iCloud locked. Your account details are linked to the Apple iPhone 6s Plus and stored on Apple’s servers; therefore, iCloud is locked. If you do not know the details of the account, the email, and the password used to register the new phone, it is a problem, and you may find it useful to know how to [bypass the iCloud activation](https://drfone.wondershare.com/icloud/bypass-icloud-activation.html) lock.

### What Does This Mean for You?

If you have an iCloud-locked iPhone, which you do not know the account details for, you can still use it. Many websites will tell you that you cannot use it at all, but you can still use it as long as the phone isn’t passcode protected. However, you cannot turn off Find My iPhone on the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, you cannot erase the Apple iPhone 6s Plus device, and you cannot reactivate the phone to set it up with your details. Most significantly, if the phone is connected to the internet, it is traceable, and the person whose account it is registered to can, at any time, wipe the phone clean and lock you out of it in any way at all. The Apple iPhone 6s Plus is not much use then unless you can find a way to unlock iCloud activation.

You can try to go about this method, but the chances are strong that you’ll give up soon, in which case you should revisit some methods mentioned earlier.

## Conclusion

As you can see, there are a lot of options with which to **unlock iCloud-locked iPhone/iPad/iPod**. There is a quick method, which is temporary. There is a permanent method, which is easy and safe. Finally, there’s also the free method, but that is extremely complicated.

You can feel free to choose the most suitable method for you, but my recommendation is that you use [Dr.Fone - Screen Unlock (iOS)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/drfone/iphone-unlock/) because in that case, a third party takes over the Apple iPhone 6s Plus SE iCloud bypass and all you have to do is wait a while.
