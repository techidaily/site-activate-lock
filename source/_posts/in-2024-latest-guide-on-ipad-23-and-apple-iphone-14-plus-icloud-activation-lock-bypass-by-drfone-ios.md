- Bypassing the activation lock is pretty much easy. However, you need to have the Apple ID credentials of the seller if you're the second owner.

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your iDevice.

- **Step 3:** Now click the Sign Out option. You can sign in with your Apple account starting there forward.

The third method involves using iCloud DNS Bypass, a technique that exploits a loophole in the iCloud Activation Lock system. iCloud DNS bypass is a temporary technique to access an iCloud-locked device's features.
