Since iOS 12.3, Apple has been using its new Activation Lock feature to deter theft. This security measure requires users to enter their iCloud login information to use an iPhone or iPad previously locked by someone else.

Checkra1n is a jailbreak tool that allows you to jailbreak your Apple iPhone 13 or iPad running iOS 12.3 and up. As part of the jailbreak tool team, it is one of the most popular jailbreak tools. Checkra1n is a semi-tethered jailbreak tool, meaning you will need to re-jailbreak your device each time you reboot it. It is, however, a very reliable jailbreak tool that is easy to use.

Checkra1n is the only jailbreak that allows for the BFU (Before First Unlock) acquisition of locked devices with an unknown passcode. It means that if you have a locked iPhone that you don't know the passcode for, you can still use checkra1n to jailbreak it and access the data.

**Pros**

- It supports iPhones, iPads, and many other devices
