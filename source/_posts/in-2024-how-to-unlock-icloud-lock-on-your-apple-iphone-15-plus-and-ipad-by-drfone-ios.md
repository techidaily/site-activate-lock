## How to Unlock iCloud lock on your Apple iPhone 15 Plus and iPad?

## Part 1: Is it possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone

Therefore, the only way you can access your device is by entering the iCloud user ID and password. Essentially what this means is that your Apple device is useless unless you find a way to unlock it. The good news is that it is possible to unlock the iCloud lock on iPhone or iPad even if you don't have the credentials using third-party software.
