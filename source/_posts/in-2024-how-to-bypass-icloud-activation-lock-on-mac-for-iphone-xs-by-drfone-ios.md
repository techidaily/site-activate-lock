### Fix 3. Download New Checkra1n Version

Crucial for a successful jailbreak is carefully selecting the [<u>appropriate Checkra1n version</u>](https://checkra.in/). Compatibility varies across devices, making it essential to choose the version that suits your device. Error 31 issues are likely linked to the specific Checkra1n version in use. In such instances, the recommended solution is to experiment with alternative versions.

![checkra1n latest version](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-14.jpg)

### Fix 4. Install iOS Firmware From iTunes and Retry Jailbreaking

When encountering **Checkra1n jailbreak**, error 31 may be attributed to the iOS version on your device. In such cases, the optimal resolution involves reinstalling the iOS version through iTunes. Follow the steps below to personally choose the IPSW file and employ iTunes for the installation on your iOS device:

- **Step 1.** Access the ipsw.me website using a web browser and download the compatible IPSW file for your iOS device. Before installing, ensure that the "Find My" service is disabled.

![disable find my on iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-15.jpg)

- **Step 2.** Connect the iOS device to the computer and wait for iTunes/Finder to detect it once all requirements are satisfied. For instance, if you have a Mac with the operating system before macOS Catalina, access the "Summary" tab by clicking the Apple iPhone XS device icon within iTunes. While holding the "Shift" key on Windows or the "Option" key on Mac, click "Restore iPhone."

![restore iphone via itunes](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-16.jpg)

- **Step 3.** You will be asked to select the IPSW file. Choose the file you downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation process. Once complete, re-try the jailbreaking and see if error 31 is resolved.

### Fix 5. Consider Using Other Options in Checkra1n

If the reason behind **Checkra1n error 31** is the Apple iPhone XS device incompatibility, Checkra1n provides an inbuilt way. When jailbreaking a device, Checkra1n allows you to select the "Untested versions" option. While employing this option, you can jailbreak the Apple iPhone XS device with iOS versions still not tested for jailbreaking. Here is how you can select these options in an attempt to jailbreak your device:

**Instructions.** To get a clean start, reboot your computer and iOS device and launch the Checkra1n app. Now, click the "Options" and select the "Untested Versions" and "Safe Mode" options. Then, try jailbreaking your device and see if error 31 is resolved.

![enable safe mode and untested versions](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-18.jpg)

### Fix 6. Try a Special Method While Using Checkra1n

At times, the solutions you are looking for can be found among the experiences of fellow users. We found a Reddit post in our search to find solutions to **Checkra1n Error 31**. In this post, a Reddit user explained a hack he had found to solve error 31 when jailbreaking using Checkra1n.

Remember that this hack includes a specific Checkra1n version and experience that specific user. While you can emulate the experience, the results aren't guaranteed. Here is what that user tried for successful jailbreaking using Checkra1n:

- **Step 1.** Download and install the Checkra1n version 0.10.2 beta on your computer. Now, connect your Apple iPhone XS to DFU Mode to the system. Initiate the jailbreaking process until the "Right before Trigger" option appears.

![reach right before trigger screen](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/best-fixes-for-checkra1n-error-31-19.jpg)

- **Step 2.** The user suggests you unplug the cable and re-plug it after waiting for 5 to 7 seconds. According to the user, this action should do the trick. To get out of DFU Mode, press and hold both buttons (Home + Lock) for 10 seconds and go on to release the home button.
