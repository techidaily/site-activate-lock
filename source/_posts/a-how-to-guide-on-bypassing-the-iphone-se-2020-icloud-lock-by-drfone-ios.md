## Part 1: 4 Efficient Methods to Bypass Apple iPhone SE (2020) iCloud Activation Lock

### 1\. Get Apple ID and password from the original device owner

For an **Apple iPhone SE (2020) iCloud bypass**, you'll require a couple of significant pieces of data:

- Bypassing the Activation Lock on iPhone is as straightforward as signing in to the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. It would help if you had the Apple ID credentials of the previous owner.
- If a device doesn't have the activation lock, you might see the passcode screen instead of the activation lock screen. Therefore, you should have the Apple iPhone SE (2020) passcode in mind.

![owners apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2022/10/iphone-4-4s-icloud-bypass-1.jpg)

After getting the required details, the following are the steps to perform **Apple iPhone SE (2020) iCloud bypass**:

- **Step 1:** Go to the Settings application on your Apple iPhone SE (2020).
- **Step 2:** Tap the Apple ID photograph from the highest point of the screen. If the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device has a newer version of iOS, then, at that point, you should tap the iCloud choice.
- **Step 3:** Now tap the “Sign Out” button. You can sign in using your own Apple ID from that point onward.
- **Step 4:** Next, look down and tap the “Sign Out” choice. When asked, you should enter the Apple ID password of the past owner to disable the Find My iPhone choice.

On the other hand, if you see the lock screen passcode, you can type the passcode and set up the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device without the Apple ID.

With the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device completely set up, access your device's Settings and sign out of the old Apple account. You can now make one more ID and Sign into it.

### 2\. Use DNS Bypass

**What is DNS?**

Domain Name System (DNS) changes over the readable names into numeric IP addresses. It utilizes the DNS server as a host to run the app. If your device is iCloud locked, one good way is to change its activation path through the DNS strategy and send it from the first Apple server to the iCloud Bypass DNS server for validation.

You can change the IP server path from the Wi-Fi settings, even if the activation screen is sprung up and you can't utilize the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. You can enter the manual Wi-Fi setting and change the DNS address. This section focuses on how you can perform **Apple iPhone SE (2020) iCloud bypass** via DNS bypass.

**Steps to Follow:**

**Note:** Before performing the iCloud DNS bypass, ensure that your device has a SIM card embedded. This step is mandatory for this process to work.

- **Step 1:** Select your nation and language from the menu on the screen.
- **Step 2:** When you continue it, you will be coordinated to the Wi-Fi setting page, requesting that you connect with a WIFI connection. Search for the “I” icon close to the Wi-Fi network.

_**Note:** If you don't see the “I” icon close by, press the Home Button> More Wi-Fi Setting and search for it._

- **Step 3:** You must disconnect the Wi-Fi. When you find the “I” icon, go to the settings tab and select the “Forget this Network” option.
- **Step 4:** Click “I” and enter a DNS server to bypass iCloud Activation Lock as per your area, against the DNS tab. Pick one from the given IP addresses according to your region:

- USA: 104.154.51.7
- South America: 35.199.88.219
- Europe: 104.155.28.90
- Asia: 104.155.220.58
- Australia and Oceania: 35.189.47.23
- Other landmasses: 104.155.28.90

- **Step 5:** After entering the IP address, tap the Back choice at the left of the screen. Now, turn on Wi-Fi, select the Wi-Fi network from the rundown and enter the code.
- **Step 6:** You will see the next page choice; don't click it and press “Back”. Now you are on the iCloud Bypass screen.

## Part 1: Basic Information about IMEI

### 1\. Understanding the IMEI Code

The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code/number is a highly unique identifying 15-digit number that distinguishes one mobile device from the other. This IMEI number is present in each and every phone regardless of the make or model. It plays an imperative role since it can be used to unlock locked mobile devices, track lost devices, and at the same time, lock a stolen mobile device remotely.

### 2\. How to Find Your IMEI Code

How to find your IMEI code depends on a number of factors such as your phone make, the model as well as the company behind your device. In most cases, you can find the code on your mobile device just under the battery casing, on the SIM Card tray, and in some situations, on the inside part of the bottom phone cover. If by chance, you still can't locate your code, I would highly advise you to dial \*#06# on your phone dial pad. This prompt dial-up happens to be the universal method used by each and every mobile company to locate the unique 15-digit IMEI number.

You can try to find your IMEI code through the other two methods: check it on your device, via iTunes or Finder, and package box.

**Method 1:** On your Apple iPhone SE (2020) device, directly go to Settings>General>About. Then you can find your IMEI code below.

![look for imei in finder](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/icloud-imei-unlock-bypass-icloud-activation-2.jpg)

On the outside of the box, a label or sticker might include various details about the Apple iPhone SE (2020) device. Look for a section specifically mentioning the IMEI number. The IMEI number and other device details are typically printed on a label or sticker.
