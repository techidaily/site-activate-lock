### Method 2: Use iCloud DNS Bypass

The Domain Name System (DNS) transmits readable domains (names) into numerical IP addresses. Whereas [iCloud DNS Bypass](http://iclouddnsbypass.com/) means we are bypassing the Activation Lock on iCloud by manipulating the DNS activation path, DNS server, and namely. You apply this method for iPhone Activation Lock removal by following the mentioned steps below:

**Step 1:** After switching on your device, select your “Country” and “Language” from the menu. Now, enter the settings page of WI-FI, tap on “Proceed” and look for the symbol “i” whenever you are asked to connect to the Wi-Fi.

**Step 2:** At that point, disconnect the internet connection and open the "Connection Settings," then tap on the "Forget this network" choice. Now hit the “i” to bypass the iCloud Activation Lock and for this, enter a DNS server IP address. You can select one of them from the given list with respect to your location:

- For Europe, it is: 104.155.28.90
- For Asia, it is: 104.155.220.58
- For the USA, it is: 104.154.51.7
- For Australia and Oceania, it is: 35.189.47.23
- For South America, it is: 35.199.88.219
- For Europe, it is: 104.155.28.90
- And for other continents, it should be: 78.100.17.60
