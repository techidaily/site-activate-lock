Your iPhone will need to be jailbroken before bypassing it using Dr.Fone.

After step 3, there are two possible outcomes for GSM and CDMA iPhone devices.

- If you own a GSM device, the unlocking will do no harm to your iOS device, and you can enjoy your Apple iPhone 15 Plus as usual.
- If the Apple iPhone 15 Plus is CDMA, you won't be able to use the Apple iPhone 15 Plus device for phone calls, cellular data, and iCloud of your new Apple ID.


### Conclusion

Turning on your iCloud's two-factor authentication is necessary for today's high-tech society. It ensures your information is always secure and minimizes the risk of getting hacked or having your account stolen. Once two-factor is active on your Apple ID, Apple provides you with a two-week window to deactivate it if you change your mind.

Meanwhile, if you forgot your iCloud and have a hard time recovering your account, you can try using dedicated programs like Dr.Fone to unlock your iOS device in a few steps.
