Undeniably, one of Apple’s selling points is its focus on security. iPhones, iPads, Macs, and other Apple stuff all enjoy this robust security system.

However, a common challenge arises when you acquire a second-hand iPhone or iPad. You may find it’s connected to the previous owner’s iCloud account through an Activation Lock.

![activation lock page ios](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2024/01/remove-icloud-activation-lock-01.jpg)

## Part 1. What Is the iCloud Activation Lock

The iCloud Activation Lock is a security feature unique to iOS. It’s intended to prevent people from accessing or resetting stolen devices. This feature is automatically enabled when “Find My iPhone” is turned on and effectively locks the Apple iPhone 15 device to a specific Apple ID.

### Attempting To Remove iCloud Activation Lock

Simply logging in with the correct Apple ID credentials will suffice to overcome this lock under normal circumstances. This process is straightforward if you are the original owner and remember your login details. However, there are instances where it could be more. You might forget your Apple ID, buy a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s account, or inadvertently reset your phone and face the iCloud Activation Lock.

In these situations, you’re left with a virtually unusable device. But there’s no need to panic. Several methods exist to bypass or remove the iCloud Activation Lock, even when the original Apple ID is unknown or forgotten. In the following sections, you’ll explore these methods. You’ll find step-by-step guidance to remove the iCloud Activation Lock to enjoy its full functionality.

## Part 2. Method 1: Remove iCloud With Apple ID Password

If you’re fortunate enough to know the Apple ID associated with the Apple iPhone 15 device, learning **how to remove iCloud Activation Lock** is straightforward. This method is ideal for those who have either forgotten their password or acquired a second-hand device still linked to the previous owner’s Apple ID but have their cooperation in unlocking it.

If you see the Activation Lock screen, it means the Apple iPhone 15 device is still tethered to an Apple ID. Follow the onscreen instructions to input the Apple ID and password initially used to set up the Apple iPhone 15 device. If the Apple iPhone 15 device has a passcode, you may also use that for unlocking. Then, you can remove the old Apple ID by going to **Settings >** Tap on the profile on top of the app > **Sign Out**.

### Removing Activation Lock via iCloud (For Offline Devices)

Alternatively, you can remove the iCloud account by following the steps below. You can ask the original owner to do this or do it independently if you can access the account.

- **Step 1:** Go to <www.iCloud.com/find> on any web browser.
- **Step 2:** Log in with your Apple ID (or the Apple iPhone 15 device owner’s ID) and password.

## How To Bypass iCloud Activation Lock on Mac For Apple iPhone 15?

_How to do Mac activation lock bypass?_

iCloud Activation Lock stands as a reliable security measure in the Apple ecosystem. It protects your Apple devices from unauthorized access and theft. Yet, navigating this security feature can be overwhelming for users locked out of their devices. It can happen due to forgotten passwords or second-hand purchases.

Mac users often seek effective methods to bypass this security measure. They aim to reclaim access to their devices without compromising safety. This article serves as a comprehensive guide, exploring the details of bypassing the iCloud **Activation Lock on Mac**. It will go through various methods, strategies, and best practices to unlock your Mac.

## Part 1. What is Mac Activation Lock?

**Mac Activation Lock**, a key part of Apple's security, safeguards your MacBook by linking it to your Apple ID. Similar to iOS devices, it makes it tough for others to access your device without permission. Once activated, it requires your Apple ID and password for various functions. These include the likes of disabling Find My Mac, erasing the Apple iPhone 15 device, or using it after a factory reset.

This feature works hand-in-hand with the 'Find My' app. It ensures your data's safety even if your MacBook is lost or stolen. Only the rightful owner can disable **Activation Lock Mac** via their Apple ID. Yet, dealing with this security measure might be challenging for genuine users. This is especially true if they face issues like forgotten passwords or when buying a used device.

![mac activation lock](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-mac-1.jpg)

Navigating through the iCloud **Activation Lock on a MacBook** can be daunting. This is especially true when faced with legitimate scenarios like forgotten passwords. It can also happen in the case of purchasing pre-owned locked devices. Yet, several methods and techniques exist to bypass this security feature. Below, we'll go through various methods for how to bypass iCloud **Activation Lock on Mac**:

### Fix 1. Retrieve Your Password

Forgetting the Apple ID password can often lead to being locked out of your own device due to the iCloud Activation Lock. Fortunately, Apple provides a streamlined process to reset and retrieve forgotten passwords. This allows users to regain entry to their devices. Apple offers a mechanism to reset forgotten passwords via the Apple ID account recovery process.

Visit the [Apple ID account page](https://appleid.apple.com/sign-in) through a web browser on any device. Choose the option that says, "Forgot password?" and continue by following the instructions shown on the screen. You might need to answer security questions, use two-factor authentication, or receive account recovery instructions. It can happen via email or SMS to reset the password.

### Fix 2. Remove Mac Activation Lock from Another Device

When faced with a Mac locked by iCloud Activation Lock, another effective method exists. You can bypass this security measure using another trusted device. That device must be linked to the same Apple ID as the Mac. Employing this method allows you to remove the Activation Lock from the locked Mac through the “Find My” feature. Follow these steps to bypass the **Mac Activation Lock**:

**Step 1.** Utilize a different Apple device, like an iPhone, iPad, or another Mac, that is currently signed in with the identical Apple ID. From there, navigate to the [iCloud website](https://www.icloud.com/) and sign in using your Apple account credentials.

![log in icloud account](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/12/bypass-icloud-activation-lock-mac-3.jpg)

**Step 2.** On the iCloud website, tap the grid icon from the top right corner and select "Find My." Here, enter your password and click on "All Devices." Choose the locked Mac from the Apple iPhone 15 device and go on to tap "Remove This Device." Now, follow the on-screen prompts to complete the process.

### Fix 3. Ask The Previous Owner for Help

Have you acquired a second-hand Mac that is locked with iCloud Activation Lock? If faced with this scenario, seeking assistance from the previous owner can prove to be a valuable solution. Describe your situation to the previous owner and kindly ask them to log in to their iCloud account for support. Otherwise, they can use the iCloud website to disassociate the Apple iPhone 15 device from their account.

They can do this by removing the Apple iPhone 15 device from their iCloud account or disabling Find My Mac. Seeking help from the previous owner to remove the **Activation Lock Mac** is often the most straightforward method.
