Activation Lock ensures that all the data present on your device is typically protected and kept safe from nefarious hands. Apple Watch Or Apple iPhone 13 Pro operates over the similar Apple ID that you have used across other devices, making its recovery and removal quite similar to the conventional methods that are adopted by people throughout the market.

## What You Want To Know About Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud On your Apple iPhone 13 Pro

Hackers have stolen millions of iCloud credentials in the past and demanded Apple pay for a ransom. This is starting to become a thing of the past as Apple implemented two-factor authentication to secure your Apple ID.

However, it's not always perfect, as sometimes you need to get past two-factor authentication on your iCloud for various reasons. That's why this article will teach you how to set it up and bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud yourself if you need to. Read further to learn more.

![everything about icloud two factor authentication](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/two-factor-authentication-intro.jpg)

## Part 1: What Is Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

Not to be confused with Apple's two-step authentication, the new and more secure two-factor authentication on iCloud introduces push notifications on your iOS device to keep your data safe. With Apple's two unique ways to prove your identity, hackers will find it harder to access your personal and financial data.

Switching to two-factor authentication rather than two-step is becoming more common nowadays as security measures are more advanced. You can always switch your security measure at any point, but remember that two-factor authentication is now an essential way to keep your data safe.

## Part 2: What Are the Benefits of Two-Factor Authentication?

Setting up two-factor authentication is a secure way to protect your device against unauthorized access. Adding another layer to your username and password highly reduces the chances of hackers obtaining your account.

Here are some of the benefits of activating two-factor authentication on your device.

- **Improved security** - A second form of identification aside from your password reduces the chance for someone to gain access to your information.
- **Interconnectivity to mobile engagement** - Two-factor authentication from businesses provides users with a stronger login system to ensure their information is safe in the digital world.
- **Reduces Fraud** - Due to the rise of identity theft in recent years, businesses risk losing trust, brand equity, and credibility. A secure authentication system adds a layer of protection to keep you secure.

If you haven't set up two-factor authentication yet on your iCloud, here are the steps to activate it right now.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone 13 Pro/iPad, go to **Settings** and tap your Apple ID profile at the top.

![setup icloud 2 factor authentication iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/setup-icloud-two-factor-authentication.jpg)

**Step 2**: Tap **Password & Security** and turn On **Two-Factor Authentication**.

**Step 3**: Enter a phone number to receive the two-factor code via an SMS or a phone call.

**Step 4**: Enter the 6-digit verification code received on your device and wait for the process the finish.

**Note**

You can turn off two-factor authentication within two weeks of enrollment. After that, it's permanent.

## Part 4: How To Turn Off Two-Factor Authentication on Your Apple iPhone 13 Pro?

As previously stated, once two-factor authentication is active on iCloud, you only have a two-week window to deactivate it again.

To get past two-factor authentication on iCloud, Go to **Settings** > **your name** > **Password & Security**. Tap **Two-Factor Authentication** and turn it **Off** again.

Meanwhile, here are the steps to learn how to bypass 2-step verification on iCloud on the web.

**Step 1**: Go to the [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/#!&page=signin) sign-in page and log in with your Apple ID.

**Step 2**: Click **Sign-In and Security > Account Security**.

![setup icloud 2 factor authentication iphone](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/turn-off-two-factor-authentication-icloud.jpg)

**Step 3**: Click **Turn Off Two-Step Verification.** Answer a security question you've set up previously to finish the process.

## Part 5: Is It Possible to Bypass Two-Factor Authentication for iCloud?

If you're wondering how to bypass two-factor authentication on iCloud, the answer is no, you can't. However, if you don't have access to your trusted device, you can have a code sent to your trusted phone number via an SMS or an automated phone call to prove to Apple that you own the iCloud account.

If this is impossible, you should request [account recovery](https://iforgot.apple.com/) to regain access to your account.

The easiest way to prevent this issue is by adding another phone number to your Apple ID so you'll always have a backup. Here's how.

**Step 1**: On your Apple iPhone 13 Pro, go to **Settings** and tap on your **Apple ID** > **Password & Security**.

**Step 2**: Tap **Edit** and choose to **Add a Trusted Phone Number**. You'll have to enter your device's passcode to continue.

![add trusted phone number apple id](https://images.wondershare.com/drfone/article/2023/01/add-trusted-phone-number-icloud.jpg)

**Step 3**: Enter your new phone number. Select a way to receive a verification code via sms or phone call and tap **Send**.

**Step 4**: Enter the verification code and wait for the process to finish.
